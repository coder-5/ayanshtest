 You have 100 minutes for 32 Problems.
 Mark your answers on your Answer Form with 
a pencil. 
 Extra scratch paper is neither given nor allowed. 
You may use blank pages/spaces in the booklet 
as scratch paper.
 There are no penalties for incorrect answers. 
Answer as many problems as you can; go 
back and check your work and also go to 
questions you skip, before the time is over.
 Calculators are not permitted. Cell phones 
must be turned off completely and placed out 
of sight. MathCON problems are ALL done 
without a calculator .
 The problems are divided into three categories 
by difficulty levels:
 3 Points (Questions 1-8)   
 5 Points (Questions 9-24) 
 7 Points (Questions 25-32)
 Problems 29-32, the last four problems are 
constructed-response problems. Enter your 
numerical answer in the grid on your answer 
sheet as shown on the right. 
1. Although not required, it is suggested that 
you write your answer from left to right in 
the boxes at tha top of the columns to help 
you fill in the circles accurately. You will 
receive credit only if the circles are filled 
in correctly. 2. Mark no more than one circle in any column.
3. You may start your answers in any column, 
space permitting. Columns you don’t use 
should be left blanks, and there should be 
no blank columns between columns that 
are not blank. For example, if your answer 
is 201, then either arrangement of filled-in 
circles shown below is acceptable. 
 For example: Answer: 201 – either position 
is correct.
