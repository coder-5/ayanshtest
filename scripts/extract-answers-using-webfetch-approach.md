# AMC8 Answer Extraction Problem Analysis

## Current Situation:

- **Database**: 632 AMC8 questions, only 281 have correct answers marked (44%)
- **JSON file**: Only 47 out of 649 questions have correct answers
- **User expectation**: 100% completion - all answers available on AoPS

## Why Direct HTTP Scraping Failed:

1. Rate limiting after ~50 requests
2. Regex patterns not matching actual HTML format
3. Connection errors (ENOTFOUND, ECONNRESET)

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Manual AoPS Answer List

AoPS provides official answer keys. Check if there's a consolidated answer list URL.

### Option 2: Use Existing Scraped Solutions

The JSON already has `solution` text for each problem. Parse the solution text to extract the final answer.

Example from JSON:

```
"solution": "...calculations... Therefore, the answer is percent of the grid."
```

The answer letter/value is embedded in the solution text!

### Option 3: Extract from Solution Text

Instead of scraping HTML, parse the existing `solution` field in amc8-ultimate.json to find patterns like:

- "Therefore, the answer is (D)"
- "The answer is percent" â†’ match to option
- "boxed{D}"
- "answer is D"

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

**Parse existing solution text in JSON file** - we already have 649 solutions, just need to extract the answer from them!

This avoids:

- Network requests
- Rate limiting
- HTML parsing complexity

Let's create a script that:

1. Reads amc8-ultimate.json
2. For each question with options but no isCorrect marked
3. Parse the solution text to find the answer letter/value
4. Match to the corresponding option
5. Update database to mark that option as correct
