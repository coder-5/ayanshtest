Grade 5 Sample Final eBook Test Solutions
1.
Solution. As y?-1=z?+2 =m? +12, the greatest value among y?, z? and m? is y?. On the
other hand, as x + 4 = t —3, the greatest value among x and t is t. Thus, when we compare t
and y? by using t — 3 = y? — 1, we have t = y? +2. Thatis, t is the greatest among all of them.
The answer is [D]. Oo
2.
Solution. Since a+b is an odd number then a and b both cannot be odd or even at the same
time. This lead us to decide a-b is always an even number since odd time even gives us always
an even number.The other two options, | and Ill, don’t always create an even number. The
answer is [B}. Oo
3.
Solution. We consider ANGLE as a one piece. Then there are 4 pieces to arrange. Therefore
there are 4! = 24 ways. The answer is [D]. oO
4.
Solution. Using Heron’s area formula for triangles, the area of the triangle with sides 10, 10
and 12 is
V16- (16 — 10) - (16 — 10) - (16 — 12) = V16-6-6-4 = 48.
The answer is [A]. O
5.
r ¥ ‘ 4 3N
Solution. Letting N be the number of problems in the test, Junaid attemps Tr problems where
5 3N_ 15N 15N
3° 4 = DD of them are correct. Since he answered 105 problems correctly, i.e. 105 = om
we have N = 224. The answer is[B]. Oo
6.
Solution. Since CAB is divisible by 5, the value of B is either 0 or 5. However, BCA is a three
digit number, therefore B = 5. On the other hand, since ABC is divisible by 4, the value of BC
is either 52 or 56. Finally, since BCA is divisible by 9, the value of A is either 2 or 7. Therefore,
the greatest value of A-B-C is 7-5-6 = 210. The answer is [D}. oO

are C(7,2) + C(3,2) = 21 +3 = 24 such choices. Thus, the probability is BB The answer

is [D]. o
8.

Solution. The lowest integer ratio corresponding to 1 : 3 :2is2:3:4, ie. the sides of the

box are 2a,3a and 4a for some integer a. Then the volume of the box is 24a3. Hence, it would

be 192 for a = 2, while the others are not in the form 24a. The answer is [D| Oo
9.

Solution.

18 2 ab 21 1, 320

The answer is [A]. oO
10.

Solution. Assume n is the last page of the book. Then we have

-(n+1 +1)-(n+2
1+..¢n= ee, < 2020 and1+...+(n+1) = aver > 2020.
Since n is an integer, we have n < 63 in the first inequality, and n + 1 > 64 in the second
inequality. Thus n = 63. The answer is [E]. o
