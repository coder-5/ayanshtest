    "solution": "Each of the unshaded triangles has base length 2 and height 1, so they all have area (2 · 1/2) = 1. Each of the unshaded unit squares has area 1. The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded region, or 4^2 - 4 · 1 - 4 · 1 = 8. The star is then (8/16) = (1/2) = 50{100, or (B)50 percent of the entire grid. cxsmi\n\nThere are 16 total squares in the diagram and each square has 2 triangles whose areas are half the area of a unit square. Thus, the total number of triangles in the diagram is 4^2 · 2 = 32 triangles. There are 16 shaded triangles in the diagram, so the area of the star is (16/32) = (1/2) = 50{100, or (B)50 percent. Pi_in_da_box\n\nThere are 4 squares that are entirely shaded and 4 squares that have no shading. This cancels them out. The rest of the squares are half-half. Therefore the shaded region is (B)50 percent of the grid.\n\nNote that we can move one triangle from each of the four cells in the middle to each of the four corners. This will leave every cell in the grid with one triangle each, and each triangle has an area of half the area of each cell. Thus, our answer must equal to 12, and so our answer is (B)50. derekwang2048\n\nThe shaded area is a 2 × 2 square in the middle of the figure combined with 8 small triangles. Since each small triangle is 1{2 of a unit square, the star's area is equal to the area of 4 + 8 · (1/2) = 8 unit squares, which (B)50 percent of the grid. -vockey\n\nYou can move the extra half a squares and make 4 squares so there are 8/16. The answer is (B)50 percent of 16. William",

    "solution": "Let's take the numbers 2 through 14 (evens). The remainders will be 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, and 0. This sequence keeps repeating itself over and over. We can take floor(50/14) = 3, so after the number 42, every remainder has been achieved 3 times. However, since 44, 46, 48, and 50 are left, the remainders of those will be 2, 4, 6, and 1 respectively. The only histogram in which those 4 numbers are set at 4 is histogram (A). Sigmacuber\n\nWriting down all the remainders gives us In this list, there are 3 numbers with remainder 0, 4 numbers with remainder 1, 4 numbers with remainder 2, 3 numbers with remainder 3, 4 numbers with remainder 4, 3 numbers with remainder 5, and 4 numbers with remainder 6. Manually computation of every single term can be avoided by recognizing the pattern alternates from 0, 2, 4, 6 to 1, 3, 5 and there are 25 terms. The only histogram that matches this is (A). alwaysgonnagiveyouup\n\nFirst, we find all of the multiples of 7 that are even, and are therefore, in this list. Knowing that 7 is odd, and that odd+odd=even, we can find all of the even multiples of 7 by simply finding all of the multiples of 14 that fit on this list. Doing this, we end up with Now, we can clearly see that there are only 3 numbers in this list with 0 as a remainder. This disproves 2 of our 5 answers immediately. Since our remaining answers are identical until we reach 3 as a remainder, we can skip right to there. Now, we need to find all even numbers that leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 7. To do this, we add 3 to all ODD multiples of 7 because odd+odd=even. This gives us Note that we don't add 3 to 49 because that exceeds 50. This shows us that there are only 3 numbers on this list that have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, disproving histograms B and C, which say that there are 4 of these numbers. This reveals the answer to be (A). Kapurnicus Minor edit by NYCnerd",

Now you check 28. You see that 28 doesn't work because (28+50) ÷ 6 = 13 and 13 is not twice of the median, which is still 7. Therefore, only choice left is {(E) 34 HydroMathGod",

    "solution": "First, we note that there are 18 \"pairs\" of squares folded on top of each other after the folding. The minimum number of gold pairs occurs when silver squares occupy the maximum number of pairs, and the maximum number of gold pairs occurs when silver squares occupy the minimum number of pairs. The latter case occurs when all 13 silver squares are placed in different pairs, resulting in 18-13=5 gold pairs. The former case occurs when the silver squares are paired up as much as possible, resulting in 6 complete pairs and another square occupying another pair slot. Then there are 18-7=11 gold pairs. Our answer is 11+5=(C) 16. cxsmi\n\nWe can see that the least number of gold-on-gold pairs will be obtained when the 13 silver squares are placed on the two sides so that they don't overlap when folded over (because then it will minimize the number of gold-on-golds). We can see that if we split them up 6 and 7 on both sides, and then fold it, the number of gold-on-golds will be 18-13 = 5. The maximum number of gold-on-golds will be achieved when the silver squares overlap when folded over, which will increase the number of gold-on-golds. If we align 6 silver squares with each other on each side, and put the last one somewhere else, we get the maximum is 18 - 7 = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11+5=(C)16. Sigmacuber",

    "solution": "We start with the first area. Since the square is inscribed, its diagonal is 2 its side length is {2implies its area is 2, therefore the first area is π-2. The second area is R^2π-2R^2{4, found in a similar manner. Writing and solving the equation, we have The answer is {(B) 2 Tacos_are_yummy_1\n\n(Really similar to Solution 1, but has a more larger explanation for the answer) First find the area of the smaller circle with the known radius. Since the radius is 1, the area of the circle is π, and finding the side length of the square would equal to {2. Squaring that gives us the area of the square which is 2, and the shaded area of the first one is equal to π - 2. The second area can be shortened to (R^2π/4) - {≤ft(√(2R^2right)^2){4, since we only need 1{4th of the sections. We then make them equal, which makes this equation: π - 2 = (R^2π/4) - {≤ft(√(2R^2right)^2){4 Simplifying this equation would be 4π - 8 = R^2π - 2R^2. We can factor out the R^2 which makes 4π - 8 = R^2≤ft(π - 2). Dividing out the π - 2 would give us 4 on the left side. 4 = R^2 which leaves us to choice {(B) 2. Imhappy62789\n\nWe are given two circles, each with an inscribed square. In the first circle, the radius is 1 unit, and the region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. In the second circle, one quarter of the region between the circle and the inscribed square is shaded. The shaded areas in both circles are the same. Our goal is to determine the radius R of the second circle. Step 1: Set up a ratio for the areas of the shaded regions We know that the shaded region in the first circle (with radius 1) and the shaded region in the second circle (with radius R) are proportional in terms of the total area between the circle and the inscribed square. The shaded area in the second circle is one quarter of the total area between the circle and the square, while the shaded area in the first circle is the entire region. Step 2: Relate the areas to the radius Let’s recall that the area between the circle and the inscribed square is proportional to the square of the radius of the circle because the square's side length scales with the radius of the circle. So, in the first circle with radius 1: and the shaded area is proportional to the entire area between the circle and the square, i.e., 1. In the second circle with radius R: and the shaded area is one-quarter of this total area, so it is proportional to (1/4) R^2. Step 3: Set up the ratio of shaded areas We are told that the shaded areas in both circles are the same, so we set up the following equation: Step 4: Solve for R Multiply both sides of the equation by 4: Taking the square root of both sides: Thus, the radius of the second circle is {(B) 2. aoum\n\nNotice that if you shaded the rest of the region between the square and the circle, then the area would be 4 times the area of the shaded region in the smaller circle. Since the radius changes by a factor of k^2, k^2 = 4, solving for gets you 2. Hence, the answer is {(B)2 Avy11",

    "solution": "The first car, moving from town A at 25 miles per hour, takes (5/25) = (1/5) hours = 12 minutes. The second car, traveling another 5 miles from town B, takes (5/20) = (1/4) hours = 15 minutes. The first car has traveled for 3 minutes or 1{20th of an hour at 40 miles per hour when the second car has traveled 5 miles. The first car has traveled 40 · (1/20) = 2 miles from the previous 5 miles it traveled at 25 miles per hour. They have 3 miles left, and they travel at the same speed, so they meet 1.5 miles through, so they are 5 + 2 + 1.5 = (D) 8.5 miles from town A. alwaysgonnagiveyouup\n\nFrom the answer choices, the cars will meet somewhere along the 40 mph stretch. Car A travels 25mph for 5 miles, so we can use dimensional analysis to see that it will be 1 hr{25 micdot 5 mi = 1{5 of an hour for this portion. Similarly, car B spends 1{4 of an hour on the 20 mph portion. Suppose that car A travels x miles along the 40 mph portion-- then car B travels 5-x miles along the 40 mph portion. By identical methods, car A travels for (1/40cdot x = {x){40 hours, and car B travels for 5-x{40 hours. At their meeting point, cars A and B will have traveled for the same amount of time, so we have so 2x = 7, and x = 3.5 miles. This means that car A will have traveled 5 + 3.5= (D) 8.5 miles. -Benedict T (countmath1)\n\nInstead of using algebra, we can visualize how far each car has traveled every hour. Let us divide each portion of the road into distances traveled each hour: For the 25 mph portion, we divide it up into 5 sections, because 25 mph5 mi = 5 {hr. Similarly, we divide the 40 mph portion into 8 sections (40 mph5 mi = 8 {hr) and the 20 mph portion into 4 sections (20 mph5 mi = 4 {hr). Thus, we have the following diagram. After four hours, car A has reached the end of the 20 mph portion, while car B has traveled 4{5 of the 25 mph portion. We can plot the amount of distance traveled, with the red dot representing car A and the blue dot representing car B. If we keep moving the dots, they will eventually meet at segment 3.5 of the 40 mph portion of the road (note that each segment represents 1 hour of time traveled): Now, we must account for the 5 miles in the 25 mph portion. Since the two cars meet at segment 3.5 of the 40 mph portion, we add the 5 miles traveled in the 25 mph section: miles. aoum",

The sum S of this infinite geometric series is given by the formula: where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

What is the sum of the grade levels assigned to pods C, E, and F?",

    "solution": "The key observation for this solution is to observe that pods C and F both have degree 5; that is, they are connected to five other pods. This implies that C and F must contain grades 1 and 7 in either order (if C or F contained any of grades 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, then there would only be four possible grades for five pods, a contradiction). It does not matter which grade C and F gets (see Solution 2 below), so we will assume that pod C is assigned grade 1, and pod F is assigned grade 7. Next, pod D is the only pod which is not adjacent to pod F, so pod D must be assigned grade 6. Similarly, pod G must be assigned grade 2. Lastly, we need to assign grades 3, 4, and 5 to pods A, B, and E. Note that A and B are adjacent; therefore, pods A and B must contain grades 3 and 5. We conclude that E must be assigned grade 4.

Then the values k and c must satisfy c+k(c+1)=35 kc+k+c=35. We now use Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick as follows: Our only restrictions now are that k>0 k+1 > 1 and c>0 c+1>1. Other than that, each factor pair of 36 produces a valid solution (k,c), which in turn uniquely determines an arrangement. Since 36 has 9 factors, our answer is 9-2=(D)7. cxsmi\n\nSay Paulina placed n coats. That will divide the 35 hooks into n+1 spaces and 35-n empty hooks. Therefore, The values of n that satisfy this are The answer is {(D) 7.\n\nLet the number of empty hooks before the first coat be denoted as n. This means that there are n empty hooks between all the coats. In every situation, there are n + 1 gaps, since n cannot be zero. To solve the problem, subtract 2n from 35 (accounting for the n empty hooks at the beginning and n empty hooks at the end). Then subtract 1 (for the first occupied hook). After that, divide the remaining number of hooks by n + 1 (the number of hooks between coats). We do this because the first occupied hook is always after n hooks; we just need to check if the remaining hooks can be evenly divided by the number of gaps. To clarify: If n = 1: align* 35 - 2n &= 33 \\\\ 33 - 1 &= 32 \\\\ (32/n + 1) &= 16 align* Since 16 is an integer, this situation satisfies the conditions. If n = 2: We can skip the the third step, as each time you add 1 to n, it decreases by 2 from the previous situation. This situation also satisfies the conditions. Continue this process until the difference exceeds 35 - (2n + 1). We find that 7 situations satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the answer is 7.

    "solution": "Let a be the length of the shorter base, and let b be the length of the longer one. Note that these two parameters, along with the angle measures and the fact that the trapezoid is isosceles, uniquely determine a trapezoid. We drop perpendiculars down from the endpoints of the top base. Then the length from the foot of this perpendicular to either vertex will be half the difference between the lengths of the two bases, or b-a{2. Now, since we have a 30-60-90 triangle and this side length corresponds to the \"30\" part, the length of the hypotenuse (one of the legs) is 2 · (b-a/2) = b-a. Then the perimeter of the trapezoid is 2(b-a)+a+b=3b-a=30. The only other stipulation for this trapezoid to be valid is that b>a (which was our assumption). We can now easily count the valid pairs (a,b), yielding (3,11),(6,12),(9,13),(12,14). It is clear that proceeding further would cause a ≥ b, so we have (E)4 valid trapezoids. cxsmi\n\nLet x be the length of AB and DC, and let b be the length of the shorter base. Because ∠B and ∠C = 60^{°, the length of the longer base is b + (x/2) + (x/2) = b + x. Therefore, the perimeter is 3x + 2b = 30. The number of positive integer pairs (x, b) is (2,12), (4,9), (6,6), (8,3), meaning the answer is (E)4. alwaysgonnagiveyouup way where you don't have to test pairs: We can rearrange 3x + 2b = 30 to (30-3x/2) = b. We want 30-3x{2 to be a positive integer so b is a positive integer. 30 is a multiple of 3 and -3x is just subtracting multiples of 3's from 30 so every number on the numerator of 30-3x{2 is a multiple of 3 under 30 (x is also a positive integer so it can't be larger than 30 or not be a multiple of 3). For 30-3x to be divisible by 2 it must be even, so we are finding even multiples of 3 under 30 which are 24, 18, 12, and 6. Each number will give us a valid x and a valid b pair giving us 4 solutions. happymaths\n\nLet x be the length of the legs of the trapezoid. Draw the angle bisectors of the 120 degree angles. Now you have 2 equilateral triangles, and another figure in between them. Let x+a be the length of the shorter base of the trapezoid, and let 2x+a be the length of the longer base. Since the perimeter of the trapezoid is 30, 5x+2a = 30. Since x>0, and a can be negative as long as x+a>0, you get 4 solutions for (x,a), namely (2,10), (4,5), (6,0), (8,-5). Any solution with x≥10 would lead to x+a≤0. Hence, the answer is (E)4 adi2011\n\nDrop altitudes from angle A and angle D. Then, two 30-60-90 triangles and a rectangle are created.

Let: AB = DC = x (legs — equal) AD = a, BC = b (bases — not necessarily equal) So: **Perimeter = a + b + 2x = 30** --- Step 2: Use geometry From the angle info, drop perpendiculars from points A and D to base BC. This creates two right triangles with angles of 60^°, so the **height** of the trapezoid is: And the **projection** of the leg on the base is: So the total difference between the longer base and shorter base is: --- Step 3: Plug into perimeter This is the key equation: > --- Step 4: Try integer values We solve for integer a and x: Try small integer values of x so a is a **positive integer**: | x | a = 30 - 3x{2 | Is a integer? | b = a + x | | --- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | | 1 | 13.5 | ✗ | | | 2 | 12 | ✔ | 14 | | 3 | 10.5 | ✗ | | | 4 | 9 | ✔ | 13 | | 5 | 7.5 | ✗ | | | 6 | 6 | ✔ | 12 | | 7 | 4.5 | ✗ | | | 8 | 3 | ✔ | 11 | | 9 | 1.5 | ✗ | | | 10 | 0 | ✗ (not positive) | | So the valid integer combinations are: x = 2, a = 12, b = 14 x = 4, a = 9, b = 13 x = 6, a = 6, b = 12 x = 8, a = 3, b = 11 --- Step 5: Eliminate congruent ones Each trapezoid has side lengths: Legs: x Bases: a and b = a + x So all side lengths are different in each case: 1. 12, 14, 2, 2 2. 9, 13, 4, 4 3. 6, 12, 6, 6 4. 3, 11, 8, 8 All four have different sets of side lengths → all are **non-congruent**. --- ✅ Final Answer: -- ChatGpt4\n\nExplanations and Reasoning to Similar Solutions Note that trapezoid ABCD is isosceles with B and C being the bottom 2 vertices. The shape can be dissected into 3 shapes with 2 congruent right triangles separated by a rectangle. This is done by dropping an altitude, a perpendicular point on the base from each of the 2 top vertices, named E and F, respectively below A and D. The property that angles ∠B and ∠C measure 60^° is significant here, forming 30-60-90 triangles (△ABE and △DCF). Now the assumed larger ^a side BC is separated into 3 sections by the 3 shapes. Or BC = BE + EF + CF. ^b Recall that △ABE and △DCF are 30-60-90 triangles, the side length ratios are 1:3:2. Naming the length of the shorter side of the right triangles as a, and the length of side AD as b, then the trapezoid's side lengths can be expressed in only 2 variables. Now knowing AD = b, DC = 2a ^c, BC = a + b + a = 2a + b, and AC = 2a, the perimeter is b + 2a + 2a + b + 2a = 2b + 6a = 30. Simplifying, 3a + b = 15, only 4 pairs of values satisfy this condition, namely (1,12), (2,9), (3,6), (4,3). Thus there (E)4 possible non-congruent trapezoids. ^a The question asks for non-congruent trapezoids, and rotation preserves congruence so the assumption is always true WLOG. ^b The shortest side of △ABE, the length of AD (shape ADFE is a rectangle so FE = AD), and the shortest side of △DCF. ^c AB = DC = 2a, AB and DC are the hypotenuse of triangles △ABE and △DCF. moracle\n\nLet a = AD and s = AB = DC. Draw a segment from A to BC parallel to {DC, meeting {BC at point P, forming parallelogram ADCP. It follows that AP = DC = s and PC = AD = a. Isosceles △ABP has base angles measuring 60^°, so it is equilateral and BP = s. Then the perimeter of ABCD is L = 2a + 3s = 30. To satisfy this equation with positive integer values, the number a must be divisible by 3 because 2a = 3(10 - s). The only possible values for a are 3, 6, 9, and 12, each value corresponding to a different trapezoid. Greater multiples of 3 will not lead to a positive integer value for s. Therefore there are {4 different trapezoids that satisfy the conditions. The table below lists the side lengths a, s, and a + s for these 4 trapezoids, along with their perimeters. array{c|c|c|c a & s & a + s & L = 2a + 3s \\\\ 3 & 8 & 11 & 2 · 3 + 3 · 8 = 30 \\\\ 6 & 6 & 12 & 2 · 6 + 3 · 6 = 30 \\\\ 9 & 4 & 13 & 2 · 9 + 3 · 4 = 30 \\\\ 12 & 2 & 14 & 2 · 12 + 3 · 2 = 30 \\\\ array alwaysgonnagiveyouup",

    "solution": "Step 1: To find the total number of paths, observe that all paths will have 10 total steps. We have to choose which 5 of these steps will be NE (the rest will be NW). So the total number of paths is 10{5. The formula for combinations is: nr = n!{r!(n-r)! and 105 = (10!/5!×5!)=252. Step 2: Each path splits the total area of 25 in two parts. So, for any path that gives area = A, you can find a unique \"sister\" path that has an area = 25-A (in other words, the pair of paths have a combined area of 25). Possible ways to define the \"sister\" path are: Rotate the entire grid 180^° Swap each step of the original paths (for example, each NW becomes NE) (this is a reflection over the diagonal) Step 3: There are a few ways to get from this observation to the total area: There are 252/2 = 126 pairs of such paths, and the total area of each pair is 25. So the total area given by all paths is 126 × 25. Each of the 252 paths gives an area of 25 if you also count the \"sister\" paths. Since each \"sister\" path is also one of the 252, you have to divide by 2 to avoid double counting. So the total area given by all paths is 252 × 25{2. Note that the average area of two \"sister\" paths is 25{2, so you can think about every path having this area on average. So the total area given by all paths is 252 × 25{2. The final answer is (B)3150. Note: This problem has a bijection (or 1-1 correspondence) , check out Intermediate Counting & Probability, Chapter 4, and Introduction to Counting & Probability, Chapter 5 cxsmi, aleyang, MathCosine, aoum\n\nIf we test this problem on a smaller 2 × 2 diamond, we have 6 ways to go from A to B, and the total area is 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12, so the average area is (12/6) = 2, which is also the area of the diamond 2 × 2 = 4 divided by 2. If we assume this is true for a 5 × 5 diamond, then the average area is 25{2. The number of paths from A to B is 105 = 252, and 252 · (25/2) = (B)3150. alwaysgonnagiveyouup\n\nAs found, there are 252 total paths. However, we can take advantage of symmetry here. We consider the total area of the left side of the grid in each of the 252 paths. Since the total area of the left side of the grid in each of the 252 paths is equal to the total area of the right side of the grid in each of the 252 paths, and the two total areas sum to (252)(25) = 6300, then the total area of the right side of the grid is 6300/2 = {3150.",

    "solution": "We can rewrite the expression as 222,222-(22,222+2,222+222+22+2). We note that the units digit of 22,222+2,222+222+22+2 is 0 because all the units digits of the five numbers are 2 and 5·2=10, which has a units digit of 0. Now, we have something with a units digit of 0 subtracted from 222,222, and so the units digit of this expression is (B) 2.\n\nSo our answer is (B) 2. (Note that brute forcing takes lots of time and the AMC8 is a timed test)\n\nWe only care about the units digits. Thus, 2-2 ends in 0, 0-2 after regrouping(10-2) ends in 8, 8-2 ends in 6, 6-2 ends in 4, and 4-2 ends in (B) 2.\n\nWe just take the units digit of each and subtract, adding an extra ten to the first number so we don't get a negative number:\n\nWe can ignore the other digits and just do 22-2-2-2-2-2. Because you are subtracting five 2s and 2·5 = 10, you subtract 10 from 22. This gives us 12, so the last digit is (B) 2.",

Color the columns, starting with red, then blue, and alternating colors, ending with a red column. There are 12 red squares and 9 blue squares, but each 2 by 2 and 1 by 4 shape takes up an equal number of blue and red squares, so there must be 3 more 1 by 1 tiles on red squares than on blue squares, which is impossible if there is just one, so the answer is (E) 5, which can easily be confirmed to work. arfekete\n\nSuppose there are a different 2× 2 tiles, b different 4× 1 tiles and c different 1× 1 tiles. Since the areas of these tiles must total up to 21 (area of the whole grid), we have Reducing modulo 4 gives c≡ 1±od{4, or c = 1 or c = 5. If c = 1, then a + b = 5. After some testing, there is no valid pair (a, b) that works, so the answer must be (E) 5, which can be constructed in many ways. -Benedict T (countmath1)\n\nSince the rectangle is a 3x7 grid, its total area (or the number of 1x1 squares) is 21. To minimize the number of 1x1 squares used, we begin by filling the area with larger shapes. Specifically, we can use two 2x2 squares, each covering 4 squares, and two 1x4 rectangles, each also covering 4 squares. This gives us a total of 4+4=8 4+4=8 squares filled by larger shapes.After filling 16 squares, we have 5 squares left. We can then fill in 5 additional 1x1 squares, leaving us with a total of 5 1x1 squares. Thus, the least number of 1x1 squares required is (E) 5. -AADHYA2012",

(1/2)|6y - 42| = 12 |6y-42| = 24 6y - 42 = 24 OR 6y - 42 = -24 6y = 66 OR 6y = 18 y = 11 OR y = 3 However, since, as stated in the problem, y > 7, our only valid solution is (D) 11. cxsmi\n\nAs in the figure, the triangle is determined by the vectors bmatrix-2 y-7{bmatrix and bmatrix6\\\\0{bmatrix. Recall that the absolute value of the determinant of these vectors is the area of the parallelogram determined by those vectors; the triangle has half the area of that parallelogram. Then we must have that (1/2)|vmatrix-2 & y-7\\\\6 & 0vmatrix| = 12 vmatrix-2 & y-7\\\\6 & 0vmatrix = ± 24. Expanding the determinants, we find that -6(y-7) = 24 or -6(y-7) = -24. Solving each equation individually, we find that y = 3 or y = 11. However, the problem states that y > 7, so the only valid solution is (D) 11. cxsmi (again!)\n\nDraw a rectangle so that the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the rectangle. The base is 8 and the height is y - 7 , so the area is 8(y - 7) = 8y - 56 Inside the rectangle, there are 2 extra right triangles along with the original triangle. The larger right triangle has an area of half the rectangle, so it has an area of {(8y - 56/2) = 4y - 28 The smaller right triangle has a base of 2 and a height of y - 7 , so its area is {(2(y - 7)/2) = y - 7 Subtracting the extra right triangles from the area of the rectangle, you get {(8y - 56) - (4y - 28) - (y - 7) = 3y - 21 Since the problem told us that the original triangle had an area of 12, you get the equation {3y - 21 = 12 {3y = 33 {y = 11 So the answer to the problem is D .",

This is nice as it’s also the smallest value, solidifying our answer. You can also simply brute-force it or sort of think ahead - for example, getting from A to M can be done 2 ways; A arrow X arrow M (5+2) or A arrow M (8), so you should take the shorter route (5+2). Another example is M to C, two ways - one is 6+5 and the other is 14. Take the shorter route. After this, you need to consider a few more times - consider if 5+10 (Y arrow C arrow Z) is greater than 17 (Y arrow Z), which it is not, and consider if 25 (M arrow Z) is greater than 14+10 (M arrow C arrow Z) or 6+5+10 (M arrow Y arrow C arrow Z) which it is not.

    "solution": "The highest that FLYFLY can be would have to be 124124, and it cannot be higher than that, because then it would be 125125, nd 125125 multiplied by 8 is 1001000, and then it would exceed the 6 - digit limit set on BUGBUG. So, if we start at 124124·8, we get 992992, which would be wrong because both B \\& U would be 9, and the numbers cannot be repeated between different letters. If we move on to the next highest, 123123, and multiply by 8, we get 984984. All the digits are different, so FLY+BUG would be 123+984, which is 1107. So, the answer is (C)1107. - Akhil Ravuri of John Adams Middle School cxsmi (minor formatting edits) Alice of Evergreen Middle School\n\nNotice that FLYFLY = 1000(FLY) + FL{Y. Likewise, BUGBUG = 1000(BUG) + BU{G. Therefore, we have the following equation: 8 × 1001(FLY) = 1001(BUG). Simplifying the equation gives 8(FLY) = (BUG). We can now use our equation to test each answer choice. We have that 123123 × 8 = 984984, so we can find the sum: FLY+BUG = 123 + 984 = 1107. So, the correct answer is {(C)1107. - C. Re\n\nTo solve 8 · FLY = BUG without guessing, we start by noting that FLY and BUG are three-digit numbers with distinct digits. We can write FLY = 100F + 10L + Y and BUG = 100B + 10U + G , so the equation becomes: 8 · (100 · F + 10 · L + Y) = 100 · B + 10 · U + G Since 8 · FLY must also be a three-digit number, FLY must be small, specifically 100 ≤ FLY ≤ 124 , because 8 · 124 = 992 (just under 1000). We try F = 1 (since FLY must remain three digits), which gives B = 8F = 8 , leading to FLY = 123 and BUG = 8 · 123 = 984 , where all digits 1, 2, 3, 9, 8, 4 are distinct. Adding FLY + BUG = 123 + 984 = 1107 , the final answer is (C) 1107 . Sharpwhiz17 yuvag ( and slight formatting edits)",

Hence the points are bounded by a a × b rectangle. This has ab area and a+b rows and columns divisible by 3. We want ab≥ 27 and a+b minimized. If ab=27, we achieve minimum with a+b=9+3=12. If ab=28,our best is a+b=7+4=11. Note if a+b=10, ab=25. Because 25<27, there is no smaller answer, and we get (D) 11. - SahanWijetunga vockey(minor edits) phy6(minor edits)\n\nFor a row or column to have a product divisible by 3, there must be a multiple of 3 in the row or column. To create the least amount of rows and columns with multiples of 3, we must find a way to keep them all together, to minimize the total number of rows and columns with multiples of threes in it. From 1 to 81, there are 27 multiples of 3 (81/3 = 27). So we have to fill 27 cells with numbers that are multiples of 3. If we put 25 of these numbers in a 5 * 5 grid, there would be 5 rows and 5 columns (10 in total), with products divisible by 3. However, we have 27 numbers, so 2 numbers still need to be put in the 9 * 9 grid. If we put both numbers in the 6th column, but one in the first row, and one in the second row, (next to the 5 by 5 grid already filled), we would have a total of 6 columns now, and still 5 rows with products that are multiples of 3.

In order to minimize the rows and columns, the best way is to make a square. However, the closest square is 25, meaning there are two multiples of three remaining. However, you can place these multiples right above the 5x5 square, meaning the answer is {(D) 11 e Just be better Shriyans Chowdhury (minor configuration error)",

Therefore, 3 π + (x/360)(5 π) = π + (360-x/360)(5 π). Solving for x reveals x=(A) 108. MrThinker Dash11 (Edited coefficient of pi. Credit goes to MrThinker for the solution and explanation.)\n\nNotice that for the 3rd most outer ring of the circle, the ratio of the shaded region to non-shaded region is the ratio of ∠BOC to 360-∠BOC. With that, all we need to do is solve for the shaded region. The inner most circle has radius 1, and the second circle has radius 2. Therefore, the first shaded area has 4 π - π = 3 π area. The circle has total area 9 π, so the other shaded region must have 1.5 π area, as the non-shaded and shaded area is equivalent. So for the 3rd outer ring, the total area is 9 π - 4 π = 5 π, so the non-shaded part of the outer ring is 5 π - 1.5 π = 3.5 π. Now as said before, the ratio of these two areas is the ratio of ∠BOC and 360 - ∠BOC. So, (3.5/1.5) = 7{3. We have 7x:3x where 7x+3x = 360, x = 36, so our answer is 3x = 108, {(A) 108. MaxyMoosy\n\nSuppose the desired angle is some fraction x of the total degree measure of the circle. We now compile a list of the shaded and unshaded areas. The inner circle of radius 1 is completely unshaded, so it contributes 1 to the unshaded area. (Everything will be a multiple of π, so we omit it.) The inner annulus has area 2^2 - 1^2 = 3, which it contributes to the shaded area. The outer annulus has a total area of 3^2 - 2^2 = 5; the fraction x is shaded, so the shaded portion of the outer annulus contributes 5x to the shaded area, while the other 1 - x fraction is unshaded, so the unshaded portion contributes 5(1-x) to the unshaded area. We now equate and solve. Upon solving, we find that x = 3{10, so the degree measure is 360 · (3/10) = (A) 108. cxsmi",

    "solution": "Jordan has 10 high top sneakers, and 6 white sneakers. We would want as many white high-top sneakers as possible, so we set 6 high-top sneakers to be white. Then, we have 10-6=4 red high-top sneakers, so the answer is (4/15).\n\nWe first start by finding the number of red and white sneakers. (3/5) × 15=9 red sneakers, so 6 are white. Then (2/3) × 15=10 are high top sneakers, so 5 are low top sneakers. Now think about 15 slots, and the first 10 are labeled high-top sneakers. If we insert the last 5 sneakers as red sneakers, there are 4 leftover red sneakers. Putting those 4 sneakers as high top sneakers, we have our answer as C, or (4/15). -ermwhatthesigma -slight change by the-guy-with-the\"W\"hairline-and-a-not-goofy-looking-gyat-with-so-much-recoil-it-bounces-to-the-nearest-blackhole...\n\nThere are 3{5cdot 15 = 9 red pairs of sneakers and 6 white pairs. There are also 2{3cdot 15 = 10 high-top pairs of sneakers and 5 low-top pairs. Let r be the number of red high-top sneakers and let w be the number of white high-top sneakers. It follows that there are 9-r red pairs of low-top sneakers and 6-r white pairs. We must have 9-r ≤ 5, in order to have a valid amount of white sneakers. Solving this inequality gives r≥ 4, so the smallest possible value for r is 4. This means that there would be 9-4=5 pairs of low-top red sneakers, so there are 0 pairs of low-top white sneakers and 6 pairs of high top white sneakers. This checks out perfectly, so the smallest fraction is (C)(4/15). -hola\n\n15 × (3/5)=9, which is the number of red pairs of sneakers. Then, (2/3) × 15=10, so there are ten pairs of high-top sneakers. If there are ten high-top sneakers, there are five low top sneakers. To have the lowest amount of high-top red sneakers, all five of the low-top sneakers need to be red. There are four red sneakers remaining so they have to be high-top. So the answer is (C)(4/15).

We are given that (g + 2/y - 2) = 4{1, so g + 2 = 4y - 8, since g = 3y, we have 3y + 2 = 4y - 8, so y = 10 and g = 30.

    "solution": "The roll of tape is 1/0.015=66 layers thick. In order to find the total length, we have to find the average of each concentric circle and multiply it by 66. Since the diameter of the small circle is 2 inches and the diameter of the large one is 4 inches, the \"middle value\" (or mean) is 3. Therefore, the average circumference is 3π. Multiplying 3π · 66 gives approximately (B) {600.\n\nThere are about (1/0.015)=200{3 \"full circles\" of tape, and with average circumference of 4+2{2pi=3π. (200/3) · 3π=200π, which means the answer is {600.\n\nWe can figure out the length of the tape by considering the side of the tape as a really thin rectangle that has a width of 0.015 inches. The side of the tape is wrapped into an annulus(The shaded region between 2 circles with the same center), meaning the area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the really thin rectangle. The area of the shaded region is π((4/2))^2 -π((2/2))^2 = 3π, and we divide that by 0.015 to get 200π. Approximating π to be 3, we get the final answer to be 200 · 3 = (B) 600.\n\nThe volume of the tape is always the same, but we can either calculate it when the tape is unrolled as a really long, thin rectangular prism, or we can calculate it as a cylinder with a hole cut out of it. When we calculate it as a long rectangular prism, we can say that the length is X (this is what the problem wants!) and the width is Y. Then, the volume is, of course, 0.015 · X · Y. Now, notice that the \"width\" of our rectangular prism is also the \"height\" of our cylinder with a hole cut out of it. Then, we can calculate the volume as base times height, or in this case, 3π · Y. Now, since the volume always stays the same, we know that 3π · Y = 0.015 · X · Y. Cancelling the Y's give us an equation for X, and if we approximate π as 3, then X = {600.\n\nIf you cannot notice that the average diameter is 3, you can still solve this problem by the following method. The same with solution 1, we have 1000{0.015 layers of tape. If we consider every layers with the diameter 2, the length should be (1000/0.015)2π≈ 400. If the diameter is seem as 4, the length should be 800. So, the length is between 400 and 800, the only possible answer is {600.",

This partitions the segment into 1000 congruent pieces that each pass through f(3, 5) cells, which means the answer is Note that a new square is entered when the lines pass through one of the lines in the coordinate grid, which for f(3, 5) happens 3-1+5-1=6 times. Because 3 and 5 are relatively prime, no lattice point except for the endpoints intersects the line segment from (0, 0) to (3, 5). This means that including the first cell closest to (0, 0), The segment passes through f(3, 5)=6+1=7 cells. Thus, the answer is (C)7000}. Alternatively, f(3, 5) can be found by drawing an accurate diagram, leaving you with the same answer. BS2012 Note: A general form for finding f(x, y) is x+y-gcd(x, y).

To make use of them all, use 2 and 3 as the bases and 2 and 0 as the exponents. spacepandamath13 .\n\nIf 0 is a base, then the whole expression becomes 0. Therefore, 0 must be an exponent. But since 2^0=3^0=1, we do not want to waste our 3 on the 0. We will have a 3 and a 2 left, and since 3^2 is greater than 2^3, we get 3^2·2^0=9. DrDominic",

    "solution": "If we extend the lines, we have the following diagram: Therefore, we see that the answer is (B)1. MrThinker\n\nNote that the y-intercepts of line AB and line CD are 0 and 10. If the analytic expression for line AB is y=k_1x, and the analytic expression for line CD is y=k_2x+10, we have equations: 3k_1 = 1 and 2k_2 + 10 = 9. Solving these equations, we can find out that k_1 = 1{3 and k_2 = -1{2. Therefore, we can determine that the expression for line AB is y=(1/3)x and the expression for line CD is y=-(1/2)x + 10. When x=15, the coordinates that line AB and line CD pass through are (15, 5) and ≤ft(15, 5{2right), and (15, 5) lies perfectly on one vertex of the rectangle while the y coordinate of ≤ft(15, 5{2right) is out of the range 3 ≤ y ≤ 5 (lower than the bottom left corner of the rectangle (15, 3)). Considering that the y value of the line CD will only decrease, and the y value of the line AB will only increase, there will not be another point on the rectangle that lies on either of the two lines. Thus, we can conclude that the answer is (B)1. Bloggish",

    "solution": "Let's use the most stamps to make 7.10. We have 20 of each stamp, 5-cent (nickels), 10-cent (dimes), and 25-cent (quarters). If we want the highest number of stamps, we must have the highest number of the smaller value stamps (like the coins above). We can use 20 nickels and 20 dimes to bring our total cost to 7.10 - 3.00 = 4.10. However, when we try to use quarters, the 25 cents don’t fit evenly, so we have to give back 15 cents to make the quarter amount 4.25. The most efficient way to do this is to give back a 10-cent (dime) stamp and a 5-cent (nickel) stamp to have 38 stamps used so far. Now, we just use (425/25) = 17 quarters to get a grand total of 38 + 17 = {(E)55. apex304, SohumUttamchandani, wuwang2002, TaeKim, Cxrupptedpat, InterstellerApex, mahika99\n\nThe value of his entire stamp collection is 8 dollars. To make 7.10 with stamps, he should remove 90 cents worth of stamps with as few stamps as possible. To do this, he should start by removing as many 25 cent stamps as possible as they have the greatest denomination. He can remove at most 3 of these stamps. He still has to remove 90-25·3=15 cents worth of stamps. This can be done with one 5 and 10 cent stamp. In total, he has 20·3=60 stamps in his entire collection. As a result, the maximum number of stamps he can use is 20·3-5={(E)55. pianoboy MathFun1000 (Rewrote for clarity and formatting) vadava_lx (minor edits)",

    "solution": "Note that Viswam walks at a constant speed of 60 blocks per hour as he takes 1 minute to walk each block. After walking 5 blocks, he has taken 5 minutes and has 5 minutes remaining to walk 7 blocks. Therefore, he must walk at a speed of 7 · 60 ÷ 5 = 84 blocks per hour to get to school on time, from the time he starts his detour. Since he normally walks 1{2 mile, which is equal to 10 blocks, 1 mile is equal to 20 blocks. Therefore, he must walk at 84 ÷ 20 = 4.2 mph from the time he starts his detour to get to school on time, so the answer is {(B)4.2. pianoboy (Edits by ILoveMath31415926535, apex304 and MrThinker)\n\nViswam walks 10 blocks, or half a mile, in 10 minutes. Therefore, he walks at a rate of 3 mph. When he takes his detour, he must travel 7 blocks instead of 5. Our final equation is (7/5) × 3 = (21/5) = {(B)4.2. -ILoveMath31415926535 Note: In the second half of his journey, he is travelling 7/5 as far as he originally expected to, so he needs to travel at 7/5 the speed to get there on time. —wescarroll\n\nWhen calculating the speed of his normal route, we get: 0.5 miles10 minutes= 3 miles{60 minutes Keep in mind that his route is 10 blocks long. Since we count 7 blocks when the detour starts, than this would mean that he has 7{10 miles left to walk, considering the normal amount of blocks that he usually walks. Multiplying by 6 to get the rate, we get, (42/10)=4.2 Therefore, the answer is {(B)4.2.",

    "options": [],
    "solution": "Since 20≡2±od3 and Q is in the 2nd diagonal, it is also in the 20th diagonal, and so we find that there are 2(2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + 17) + 20 = 134 {Qs. Since all the {P's and {R's are symmetric, the answer is (C)133 Ps, 134 Qs, 133 Rs. ILoveMath31415926535\n\nNotice that rows x and x+3 are the same, for any 1 ≤ x ≤ 17. Additionally, rows 1, 2, and 3 collectively contain the same number of {Ps, {Qs, and {Rs, because the letters are just substituted for one another. Therefore, the number of {Ps, {Qs, and {Rs in the first 18 rows is 120. The first row has 7 {Ps, 7 {Qs, and 6 {Rs, and the second row has 6 {Ps, 7 {Qs, and 7 {Rs. Adding these up, we obtain (C)133 Ps, 134 Qs, 133 Rs. mathboy100\n\nThis solution refers to the full diagram in Solution 4. Note the Q diagonals are symmetric. The {R and {P diagonals are not symmetric, but are reflections of each other about the {Q diagonals: The upper {Q diagonal of length 2 is surrounded by a {P diagonal of length 3 and an {R diagonal of length 1. The lower {Q diagonal of length 2 is surrounded by a {P diagonal of length 1 and an {R diagonal of length 3. When looking at a pair of Q diagonals of the same length x, there is a total of 2x {Rs and {Ps next to these 2 diagonals. The main diagonal of 20 {Qs has 19 {Ps and 19 {Rs next to it. Thus, the total is x+1 {Qs, x {Ps, x {Rs. Therefore, the answer is (C)133 Ps, 134 Qs, 133 Rs. ERMSCoach",

We can build an equation of 5X-3Y=2023, where we have to limit the number of moves we do. We can do this by making more of our moves the 5 move turn than the 3 move turn. The first obvious step is to go some amount of moves in the right direction then subtract off in the left direction to land on 2023. The least amount of 3’s added to 2023 to make a multiple of 5 is 4 as 2023 + 4(3) = 2035. So now, we have solved the problem as we just go (2035/5) = 407 hops right, and just do 4 more hops left.

    "solution": "First, we need to find the sum of each group when split. This is the total sum of all the elements divided by the # of groups. 1 + 2 ... + 9 = (9(10)/2) = 45. Then, dividing by 3, we have (45/3) = 15, so each group of 3 must have a sum of 15. To make the counting easier, we will just see the possible groups 9 can be with. The possible groups 9 can be with 2 distinct numbers are (9, 2, 4) and (9, 1, 5). Going down both of these avenues, we will repeat the same process for 8 using the remaining elements in the list. Where there is only 1 set of elements getting the sum of 7, 8 needs in both cases. After 8 is decided, the remaining 3 elements are forced in a group, yielding us an answer of {(C)2 as our sets are (9, 1, 5) (8, 3, 4) (7, 2, 6) and (9, 2, 4) (8, 1, 6) (7, 3 ,5). CHECKMATE2021, apex304, SohumUttamchandani, wuwang2002, TaeKim, Cxrupptedpat\n\nThe group with 5 must have the two other numbers adding up to 10, since the sum of all the numbers is (1 + 2 ... + 9) = (9(10)/2) = 45. The sum of the numbers in each group must therefore be (45/3)=15. We can have (1, 5, 9), (2, 5, 8), (3, 5, 7), or (4, 5, 6). With the first group, we have (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) left over. The only way to form a group of 3 numbers that add up to 15 is with (3, 4, 8) or (2, 6, 7). One of the possible arrangements is therefore (1, 5, 9) (3, 4, 8) (2, 6, 7). Then, with the second group, we have (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) left over. With these numbers, there is no way to form a group of 3 numbers adding to 15. Similarly, with the third group there is (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9) left over and we can make a group of 3 numbers adding to 15 with (1, 6, 8) or (2, 4, 9). Another arrangement is (3, 5, 7) (1, 6, 8) (2, 4, 9). Finally, the last group has (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9) left over. There is no way to make a group of 3 numbers adding to 15 with this, so the arrangements are (1, 5, 9) (3, 4, 8) (2, 6, 7) and (3, 5, 7) (1, 6, 8) (2, 4, 9). So，there are {(C)2 sets that can be formed. Turtwig113\n\nThe sum of the numbers across all equally valued sets is (1 + 2 ... + 9) = (9(10)/2) = 45. The value of the numbers in each set would be (45/3) =15. We know that the numbers 9, 8, and 7 must belong in different sets, as putting any 2 numbers in 1 set will either pass or match the limit of 15 per set, and we would then still need to add 1 more number after that. Note that these numbers must be distinct, as Alina only has 1 of each number, and order does not matter in the sets. Starting with the set that includes the number 9, the next two numbers must add up to 6, and there are 2 ways of doing this (2,4) (1,5). Note we cannot use any number past 6, as those numbers must be used in the other sets. The next set, which includes the number 8, must have two numbers that add up to 7, and there are 3 ways to do this (2,5) (1,6) (3,4). The final set, which includes the number 7, must have 2 numbers that sum up to 8, and there are 2 ways to do this (2,6) (3,5). Now we have found the number of ways in which each set sums up to 15. To find the number of ways in which all three sets sum up to 15 concurrently, we must take the minimum of 2, 3, and 2, which gives us an answer of {(C)2 triplets of sets with 3 values, in which each set sum to the same amount. Fernat123\n\nNote that each group of numbers should sum to (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9/3) = 15. Thus, this is equivalent to asking, “How many ways can you fill in a three by three magic square with the integers 1 through 9?” since we can take the three rows of the magic square as our three groups. If you have closely studied magic squares, you might know that in a three by three magic square that is to be filled in with the integers 1 through 9, the center of the square would be 5 (the average of the numbers), and the numbers in the corners should be even(*). The such pairs (disregarding order) are (2,8) and (4,6). Let’s fix the position of 2 to be the top left corner. This would make 8 in the bottom right corner. We can have either 4 or 6 to be in the top right corner, for a total of {(C)2 such groups of three. (The groups are (8,3,4) (1,5,7) (6,9,2) and (8,1,6) (3,5,7) (4,9,2).) Note that if we had instead fixed the position of 4, 6, or 8, they would correspond to one of the two cases, just in a different configuration. (*)We can prove this using proof by contradiction. Label the nine small squares within the magic square from a to i from left to right, top to bottom. Firstly, we know that a+i and c+g sum to 10 since the center square is 5. Thus, a and i must have the same parity, and so must c and g. Suppose that a and c have different parity. Since a+b+c=15, b must be even. By a similar argument, h must also be even, and so must d and f. Our initial assumption is that one of a and c is odd and the other is even; however, we end up with six even numbers needed to fill in the square, but there are only four even integers from 1 to 9. Now suppose that all of a, c, g, and i are odd. This would make each of b, d, f, and h odd, but clearly we do not have enough odd numbers to make all nine numbers odd. Thus, each corner square must be even. Brian__Liu",

Similarly, we can find that the area of the gray part in the second triangle is [ABC]·≤ft(h-5{hright)^2. These areas are equal, so 1-≤ft((11/hright)^2=≤ft({h-5){hright)^2. Simplifying yields 10h=146 so h=(A) 14.6. MathFun1000 (edits apex304)\n\nWe can call the length of AC as x. Therefore, the length of the base of the triangle with height 11 is 11/h = a/x. Therefore, the base of the smaller triangle is 11x/h. We find that the area of the trapezoid is (hx)/2 - 11^2x/2h. Using similar triangles once again, we find that the base of the shaded triangle is (h-5)/h = b/x. Therefore, the area is (h-5)(hx-5x)/2h. Since the areas are the same, we find that (hx)/2 - 121x/2h = (h-5)(hx-5x)/2h. Multiplying each side by 2h, we get h^2x - 121x = h^2x - 5hx - 5hx + 25x. Therefore, we can subtract 25x + h^2x from both sides, and get -146x = -10hx. Finally, we divide both sides by -x and get 10h = 146. h is (A)14.6.

The number 18 is similarly found. 19, however, is too much. Now, we check with the first and last equations using the same method. We know 241-10≤ 14x≤250-1. Therefore, 231≤ 14x≤249. We test both values we just got, and we can realize that 18 is too large to satisfy this inequality.

The total area of the triangles not in the figure is 12 · (1/2) = 6, so the answer is 16-6 = (A) 10. hh99754539\n\nDraw the following four lines as shown: The area of the big square is 4, and the area of each triangle is 0.5. There are 12 of these triangles, so the total area of all the triangles is 0.5·12=6. Therefore, the area of the entire figure is 4+6=(A) 10. RocketScientist",

    "solution": "Let the smallest number be x. It follows that the largest number is 4x. Since x,15, and 4x are equally spaced on a number line, we have MRENTHUSIASM\n\nLet the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be d. Consequently, the smallest number is 15-d and the largest number is 15+d. As the largest number is 4 times the smallest number, 15+d=60-4d d=9. Finally, we find that the smallest number is 15-9=(C) 6. MathFun1000\n\nLet the smallest number be x. Because x and 4x are equally spaced from 15, 15 must be the average. By adding x and 4x and dividing by 2, we get that the mean is also 2.5x. We get that 2.5x=15, and solving gets x=(C) 6. DrDominic\n\nSince the problem is giving us the options, we can try all of them. The differences MUST be equal because the numbers have to be evenly spaced on the number line. We see that 4 cannot work because 15 - 4 = 11, and 4 * 4 = 16. 16 - 15 is not 11, so this option does not work. Next, we can try 5. We see that this also does not work because 15 - 5 = 10, and 5 * 4 = 20. 20 - 15 = 5, and this is not 10. We can then try 6 to see that it does work. 15 - 6 = 9, and 6 * 4 = 24. 24 - 15 = 9. The differences are equivalent, so we can see that 6 indeed does work. Therefore, the answer is (C) 6. Brainiacs77",

    "solution": "Let's say that the first strand of pasta he had is x. The first time he takes a bite of this strand will make it 2 pieces. This is x - 3. The second time he takes the bites of EACH strand will become (x - 3) * 3(2). The 2 is for the two bites he took, 1 for each strand. This equation is showing that for every bite that he is taking, he is taking off 3 inches. This is being showed in the 3(2). He took 2 bites, each taking off 3 inches. Now, the problem is stating that their are 10 pieces of pasta and the TOTAL length is 17 inches. We have to plug in the total number of bites to the equation (x - 3) * 3( ). To find this out, we can see that for the number of strands there are, he took 1 less bite than that number. For example, if there are 2 pieces, he took 1 bite to get those. Since there are 10 pieces, he took 9 bites. The equation then becomes, (x - 3) * 3(9) = 17. To solve this, x = 44. Therefore, the answer is (D) 44. Brainiacs77\n\nIf there are 10 pieces of pasta, Henry took 10-1=9 bites. Each of these 9 bites took 3 inches of pasta out, so all his bites in total took away 9· 3 = 27 inches of pasta. Thus, the original piece of pasta was 27+17=(D) 44 inches long. wamofan",

    "solution": "First, we calculate that there are a total of 4·4=16 possibilities. Now, we list all of two-digit perfect squares. 64 and 81 are the only ones that can be made using the spinner. Consequently, there is a (2/16)=(B) dfrac1{8 probability that the number formed by the two spinners is a perfect square. MathFun1000\n\nThere are 4 · 4 = 16 total possibilities of N. We know N=10A+B, which A is a number from spinner A, and B is a number from spinner B. Also, notice that there are no perfect squares in the 50s or 70s, so only 4-2=2 values of N work, namely 64 and 81. Hence, (2/16)=(B) dfrac1{8. MrThinker\n\nJust try them! If we spin a 5 on the first spinner, there are no solutions. If we spin a 6 on the first spinner, there is one solution (64). If we spin a 7 on the first spinner, there are no solutions. If we spin an 8 on the first spinner, there is one solution (81). Therefore, there are 2 solutions and 4 · 4 = 16 total possibilities, so ligonmathkid2",

Let y be the number in the lower middle. It follows that x+y+8=12, or x+y=4. We express the other two missing numbers in terms of x and y, as shown below: We have x>x-1, x>y+10, and x>y. Note that the first inequality is true for all values of x. We only need to solve the second inequality so that the third inequality is true for all values of x. By substitution, we get x>(4-x)+10, from which x>7. Therefore, the smallest possible value of x is (D) 8}.

We construct the following table of 5-minute intervals: Note that Zia will wait for the bus after 15 minutes, and the bus will arrive 2 minutes later. Therefore, the answer is 15+2=(A) 17}. MRENTHUSIASM\n\nSince Zia will wait for the bus if the bus is at the previous stop, we can create an equation to solve for when the bus is at the previous stop. The bus travels 13 of a stop per minute, and Zia travels 1{5 of a stop per minute. Now we create the equation, (1/3)m = (1/5)m + 3 - 1 (the -1 accounts for us wanting to find when the bus reaches the stop before Zia's). Solving, we find that m=15. Now Zia has to wait 2 minutes for the bus to reach her, so our answer is 15+2=(A) 17. kn07",

    "solution": "Clearly, the amount of money Ricardo has will be maximized when he has the maximum number of nickels. Since he must have at least one penny, the greatest number of nickels he can have is 2019, giving a total of (2019· 5 + 1) cents. Analogously, the amount of money he has will be least when he has the greatest number of pennies; as he must have at least one nickel, the greatest number of pennies he can have is also 2019, giving him a total of (2019· 1 + 5) cents. Hence the required difference is\n\nSuppose Ricardo has p pennies, so then he has (2020-p) nickels. In order to have at least one penny and at least one nickel, we require p ≥ 1 and 2020 - p ≥ 1, i.e. 1 ≤ p ≤ 2019. The number of cents he has is p+5(2020-p) = 10100-4p, so the maximum is 10100-4 · 1 and the minimum is 10100 - 4 · 2019, and the difference is therefore",

    "solution": "Notice that, for a small cube which does not form part of the bottom face, it will have exactly 2 faces with icing on them only if it is one of the 2 center cubes of an edge of the larger cube. There are 12-4 = 8 such edges (as we exclude the 4 edges of the bottom face), so this case yields 2 · 8 = 16 small cubes. As for the bottom face, we can see that only the 4 corner cubes have exactly 2 faces with icing, so the total is 16+4 = (D) 20.\n\nThe following diagram shows 12 of the small cubes having exactly 2 faces with icing on them; that is all of them except for those on the hidden face directly opposite the front face. But the hidden face is an exact copy of the front face, so the answer is 12+8=(D) 20.\n\nIt is observable that only the middle-edged pieces of each face will have the icing exactly on two sides. There are 4 such pieces on each face. Considering 5 faces of the cube (since the bottom is not iced), we can state that the number of such pieces of dimensions 1x1x1 will be 5x4=20. Therefore, our answer is 20. Edits by WrenMath",

If we ignore the constraint that S and T cannot be next to each other, we get a total of 4!=24 ways to arrange the 4 marbles. We now simply have to subtract out the number of ways that S and T can be next to each other. If we place S and T next to each other in that order, then there are three places that we can place them, namely in the first two slots, in the second two slots, or in the last two slots (i.e. ST, ST, ST). However, we could also have placed S and T in the opposite order (i.e. TS, TS, TS). Thus there are 6 ways of placing S and T directly next to each other. Next, notice that for each of these placements, we have two open slots for placing A and B. Specifically, we can place A in the first open slot and B in the second open slot or switch their order and place B in the first open slot and A in the second open slot. This gives us a total of 6× 2=12 ways to place S and T next to each other. Subtracting this from the total number of arrangements gives us 24-12=12 total arrangements (C) 12. We can also solve this problem directly by looking at the number of ways that we can place S and T such that they are not directly next to each other. Observe that there are three ways to place S and T (in that order) into the four slots so they are not next to each other (i.e. S T, S T, S T). However, we could also have placed S and T in the opposite order (i.e. T S, T S, T S). Thus there are 6 ways of placing S and T so that they are not next to each other. Next, notice that for each of these placements, we have two open slots for placing A and B. Specifically, we can place A in the first open slot and B in the second open slot or switch their order and place B in the first open slot and A in the second open slot.

However, there are 2·3! arrangements where Steelie and Tiger are next to each other. (Think about permutations of the element ST, A, and B or TS, A, and B). Thus,\n\nWe use complementary counting: we will count the numbers of ways where Steelie and Tiger are together and subtract that from the total count. Treat the Steelie and the Tiger as a \"super marble.\" There are 2! ways to arrange Steelie and Tiger within this \"super marble.\" Then there are 3! ways to arrange the \"super marble\" and Zara's two other marbles in a row. Since there are 4! ways to arrange the marbles without any restrictions, the answer is given by 4!-2!· 3!=(C) 12 -franzliszt\n\nBy the Georgeooga-Harryooga Theorem, our answer is ((4-2)!(4-2+1)!/(4-2·2+1)!)=(C) 12. -franzliszt",

    "solution": "Since 20\\% = 1{5, multiplying the given condition by 5 shows that y is 15 · 5 = (C) 75 percent of x.\n\nLetting x=100 (without loss of generality), the condition becomes 0.15· 100 = 0.2· y 15 = (y/5) y=75. Clearly, it follows that y is 75\\% of x, so the answer is (C) 75.\n\nWe have 15\\%=3{20 and 20\\%=1{5, so (3/20)x=(1/5)y. Solving for y, we multiply by 5 to give y = (15/20)x = (3/4)x, so the answer is (C) 75.\n\nWe are given 0.15x = 0.20y, so we may assume without loss of generality that x=20 and y=15. This means (y/x)=(15/20)=75{100, and thus the answer is (C) 75.\n\n15\\% of x is 0.15x, and 20\\% of y is 0.20y. We put 0.15x and 0.20y into an equation, creating 0.15x = 0.20y because 0.15x equals 0.20y. Solving for y, dividing 0.2 to both sides, we get y = (15/20)x = (3/4)x, so the answer is (C) 75.\n\n15\\% of x can be written as (15/100)x, or 15x{100. 20\\% of y can similarly be written as (20/100)y, or 20y{100. So now, (15x/100) = 20y{100. Using cross-multiplication, we can simplify the equation as: 1500x = 2000y. Dividing both sides by 500, we get: 3x = 4y. 3{4 is the same thing as 75\\%, so the answer is (C) 75.",

Since A,B,C,D,E,F are unique integers between 1 and 6, we obtain A+B+C+D+E+F=1+2+3+4+5+6=21 (where the order doesn't matter as addition is commutative), so our equation simplifies to 42 + B = 47.

Because an even number 2(A+C+D+E+F) subtracted from an odd number (47) is always odd, we know that 3B is odd, showing that B is odd. Now we know that B is 1, 3, or 5.

Thus 2020 has (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12 factors. The only number which has one factor is 1. For a number to have exactly two factors, it must be prime, and the only prime factors of 2020 are 2, 5, and 101. For a number to have three factors, it must be a square of a prime (this follows from the standard formula mentioned above), and from the prime factorization, the only square of a prime that is a factor of 2020 is 4. Thus, there are 5 factors of 2020 which themselves have 1, 2, or 3 factors (namely 1, 2, 4, 5, and 101), so the number of factors of 2020 that have more than 3 factors is 12-5=(B) 7.\n\nLet d(n) be the number of factors of n. We know by prime factorization that d(2020) = 12. These 12 numbers can be divided into unordered pairs {a,b where ab = 2020. Since d(2020) = d(a)d(b), one of d(a), d(b) has 3 or less factors and the other has 4 or more - in to total 6 factors of 2020 with more than 3 factors. However, this argument has exceptions where a and b share a nontrivial common factor, which in this case can only be two. There are two cases - One in which 5 and 101 divide the same factor, WLOG assumed to be a, so that d(a) = 2^3 > 3 and d(b) = 2, as otherwise. In the other case, a = 5·2 and b = 101·2, so that d(a) = d(b) = 4. This adds one factor with more than 3 factors, so the answer is (B) 7.",

If the unknown digit is x, we deduce 5+x+5+x+5 ≡ 0 ±od3 2x ≡ 0 ±od{3.

After trying every one digit number, you'll notice that x must be a multiple of 3, meaning that x=0, 3, 6, or 9. 50505, 53535, 56565, and 59595 are the (B) 4 solutions to this question.",

    "questionText": "A scientist walking through a forest recorded as integers the heights of 5 trees standing in a row. She observed that each tree was either twice as tall or half as tall as the one to its right. Unfortunately some of her data was lost when rain fell on her notebook. Her notes are shown below, with blanks indicating the missing numbers. Based on her observations, the scientist was able to reconstruct the lost data. What was the average height of the trees, in meters?",

    "solution": "We will show that 22, 11, 22, 44, and 22 meters are the heights of the trees from left to right. We are given that all tree heights are integers, so since Tree 2 has height 11 meters, we can deduce that Trees 1 and 3 both have a height of 22 meters. There are now three possible cases for the heights of Trees 4 and 5 (in order for them to be integers), namely heights of 11 and 22, 44 and 88, or 44 and 22. Checking each of these, in the first case, the average is 17.6 meters, which doesn't end in .2 as the problem requires. Therefore, we consider the other cases. With 44 and 88, the average is 37.4 meters, which again does not end in .2, but with 44 and 22, the average is 24.2 meters, which does. Consequently, the answer is (B) 24.2.\n\nNotice the average height of the trees ends with 0.2; therefore, the sum of all five heights of the trees must end with 1 or 6. (0.2 · 5 = 1) We already know Tree 2 is 11 meters tall. Both Tree 1 and Tree 3 must 22 meters tall - since neither can be 5.5. Once again, apply our observation for solving for the Tree 4's height. Tree 4 can't be 11 meters for the sum of the five tree heights to still end with 1. Therefore, the Tree 4 is 44 meters tall. Now, Tree 5 can either be 22 or 88. Find the average height for both cases of Tree 5. Doing this, we realize the Tree 5 must be 22 for the average height to end with 0.2 and that the average height is {(B)24.2.\n\nAs in Solution 1, we shall show that the heights of the trees are 22, 11, 22, 44, and 22 meters. Let S be the sum of the heights, so that the average height will be S{5 meters. We note that 0.2 = 1{5, so in order for S{5 to end in .2, S must be one more than a multiple of 5. Moreover, as all the heights are integers, the heights of Tree 1 and Tree 3 are both 22 meters. At this point, our table looks as follows: If Tree 4 now has a height of 11, then Tree 5 would need to have height 22, but in that case S would equal 88, which is not 1 more than a multiple of 5. So we instead take Tree 4 to have height 44. Then the sum of the heights of the first 4 trees is 22+11+22+44 = 99, so using a height of 22 for Tree 5 gives S=121, which is 1 more than a multiple of 5 (whereas 88 gives S = 187, which is not). Thus the average height of the trees is (121/5) = (B) 24.2 meters.\n\nSince we know that the tree heights have to be integers, then it is immediate that Tree 1 and 3 have a height of 22. Now using the information given by the last column (that the average of the heights of the trees ends in .2), we can tell that the sum of all the heights of the trees ends in either 1 or 6, because those are the only numbers from 0 to 9 that are congruent to 1 after taking modulo 5. The two multiples of eleven (eleven because all of the tree heights have to be a multiple of eleven if they are integers) that come to mind are 66 and 121. Since the sum of the heights of Tree 1, 2, and 3 is already 55, we know that 66 is impossible to obtain. Then, we can decide with relative confidence that the answer should be (121/5) = (B) 24.2. P.S. : We can check our solution by trying to obtain 121. Surely enough, we have Tree 1 = 22, Tree 2 = 11, Tree 3 = 22, Tree 4 = 44, and Tree 5 = 22. These all add up to get 121.",

    "solution": "Notice that, to step onto any particular white square, the marker must have come from one of the 1 or 2 white squares immediately beneath it (since the marker can only move on white squares). This means that the number of ways to move from P to that square is the sum of the number of ways to move from P to each of the white squares immediately beneath it (also called the Waterfall Method). To solve the problem, we can accordingly construct the following diagram, where each number in a square is calculated as the sum of the numbers on the white squares immediately beneath that square (and thus will represent the number of ways to remove from P to that square, as already stated). The answer is therefore (A) 28. Note: This is a classic example of a problem involving Pascal's triangle. edited by Dream9, WrenMath and algebraic_algorithmic\n\nSuppose we \"extend\" the chessboard infinitely with 2 additional columns to the right, as shown below. The red line shows the right-hand edge of the original board. The total number of paths from P to Q, including invalid paths which cross over the red line, is then the number of paths which make 4 steps up-and-right and 3 steps up-and-left, which is 4+33 = 73 = 35. We need to subtract the number of invalid paths, i.e. the number of paths that pass through X or Y. To get to X, the marker has to make 3 up-and-right steps, after which it can proceed to Q with 3 steps up-and-left and 1 step up-and-right. Thus, the number of paths from P to Q that pass through X is 1 · 3+13 = 4. Similarly, the number of paths that pass through Y is 4+1{1cdot 1 = 5. However, we have now double-counted the invalid paths which pass through both X and Y; from the diagram, it is clear that there are only 2 of these (as the marker can get from X to Y by a step up-and-left and a step-up-and-right in either order). Hence the number of invalid paths is 4+5-2=7, and the number of valid paths from P to Q is 35-7 = (A) 28.\n\nOn any white square, we may choose to go left or right, as long as we do not cross over the border of the board. Call the moves L and R respectively. Every single legal path consists of 4 R's and 3 L's, so now all we have to find is the number of ways to order 4 R's and 3 L's in any way, which is 7 3=35. However, we originally promised that we will not go over the border, and now we have to subtract the paths that do go over the border. The paths that go over the border are any paths that start with RRR(1 path), RR(5 paths) and LRRR(1 path) so our final number of paths is 35-7=(A)=28. PEKKA\n\nSay our first move is to point 1. Our path from 1 to Q must have 4 upward-right moves and 2 upward-left moves, so there are (6!/4! · 2!) = 15 paths. From 2 to Q, our path must have 3 upward-right moves and 3 upward-left moves, so there are (6!/3! · 3!) = 20 paths. However, our path can't go off the grid. There are 4 invalid paths from point 2 to Q (all paths starting with right right) and 3 invalid paths from point 1 to Q (all paths starting with right right right). So the answer is 20 + 15 - (4 + 3) = (A) 28. grogg007",

Adding this to the total length of the consecutive squares, which is 24s, the side length of the large square is (24s+25d), yielding the equation ((24s)^2/(24s+25d)^2)=64{100. Taking the square root of both sides (and using the fact that lengths are non-negative) gives (24s/24s+25d)=(8/10) = 4{5, and cross-multiplying now gives 120s = 96s + 100d 24s = 100d (d/s) = (24/100) = (A) frac6{25.

Then, as the total area of the 576 gray tiles is simply 576, the large square has area (576/0.64) = 900, making the side of the large square √(900)=30. As in Solution 1, the side length of the large square consists of the total length of the gray tiles and 25 lots of the border, so the length of the border is d = (30-24/25) = 6{25. Since (d/s)=d if s=1, the answer is (A) frac6{25.",

Since soft drinks cost 1.00 dollar each, they can buy 3 soft drinks, which makes them spend 30.00 Since they bought 6 sandwiches and 3 soft drinks, they bought a total of 9 items. Therefore, the answer is (D) 9. - SBose\n\nIf the two could by fractions of sandwiches, they'd be able to buy 30.00 dollars4.50dollarssandwich=62{3 sandwiches.

    "solution": "We can see that there are 2 rectangles lying on top of the other and that is the same as the length of one rectangle. Now we know that the shorter side is 5, so the bigger side is 10, if we do 5 · 2 = 10. Now we get the sides of the big rectangle being 15 and 10, so the area is {(E)150. avamarora\n\nUsing the diagram we find that the larger side of the small rectangle is 2 times the length of the smaller side. Therefore, the longer side is 5 · 2 = 10. So the area of the identical rectangles is 5 · 10 = 50. We have 3 identical rectangles that form the large rectangle. Therefore the area of the large rectangle is 50 · 3 = {(E)150. fath2012\n\nWe see that if the short sides are 5, the long side has to be 5·2=10 because the long side is equal to the 2 short sides and because the rectangles are congruent. If that is to be, then the long side of the BIG rectangle(rectangle ABCD) is 10+5=15 because long side + short side of the small rectangle is 15. The short side of rectangle ABCD is 10 because it is the long side of the short rectangle. Multiplying 15 and 10 together gets us 15·10 which is {(E)150. mathboy282\n\nWe see that the 2 rectangles lying on top of each other give us the height of the rectangle. Using what we know, we can find out that the 2 rectangles put together is a square. So, we can infer that the length of the rectangles is 10. Adding that to the width of the third rectangle which is 5, we get that the length of the rectangle is 15. Multiplying 10 and 15 gives us 15·10 which is {(E)150. awesomepony566\n\nThere are two rectangles lying on the side and one standing up. Given that one small side is 5, we can determine that two of the small sides make up a big side which means that the long side is equal to 10. The top side of the rectangle is made up of one small side and one long side, therefore the dimensions for the rectangle is 10x15. 10 multiplied by 15 is 150, hence the answer {(E)150. elenafan",

    "solution": "When (x/y)>1 and z>0, (x+z/y+z)<x{y. Hence, the answer is (E)frac19{15<(17/13)<(15/11). ryjs This is also similar to Problem 20 on the 2012 AMC 8.\n\nSuppose each fraction is expressed with denominator 2145: (2925/2145), (2717/2145), 2805{2145. Clearly 2717<2805<2925 so the answer is (E). Note: Duplicate of Solution 1\n\nAdding on to Solution 5, we can turn each of the fractions 15{11, 17{13, and 19{15 into 14{11, 14{13, and 14{15, respectively. We now subtract 1 from each to get 4{11, 4{15, and 4{13. Since their numerators are all 4, this is easy because we know that (1/15)<(1/13)<1{11 and therefore (4/15)<(4/13)<4{11. Reverting them to their original fractions, we can now see that the answer is {(E);(19/15)<(17/13)<(15/11). by ChipmunkT\n\nAs you can see that the difference between the numerator and denominator is 4, you can guess the relative ratios and you can scale down and make it (9/5),(7/3), and (5/1),. Using this, you can very clearly tell that (5/1), is the greatest and therefore 15{11, is the greatest. You can use the same method to find the other 2 orders. This gives the answer of {(E);(19/15)<(17/13)<(15/11). Note-this answer only works in some circumstances, and overall solution 6 is much better. ParticlePhysics",

In a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other, which means {AE = 12 = {EC. Consider one of the {AB = 13, and {AE = 12. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that {BE = 5. You know the Pythagorean triple, (5, 12, 13). Thus the values of the two diagonals are {AC = 24 and {BD = 10. The area of a rhombus is = d_1·d_2{2 = 24·10{2 = 120 {(D)120\n\nRight off the bat, we can see that the perimeter of the figure is 52. Dividing this by four, we can get that each side is equal to 13. By drawing a line perpendicular to the one given, we can split the figure into four right triangles. 12 (24/2) is equal to the height of one small right triangle, and 13 is the slanted side. Using the Pythagorean theorem we can find that 169 (13 squared) - 144 (12 squared) = 25 (five squared). With this, we can determine that each small right triangle equals 30.

Now that we have this equation, we will assign y as the lowest score of the two other tests, and so: Now we know that the lowest score on the two other tests is {48. aopsav\n\nRight now, she scored 76, 94, and 87 points, for a total of 257 points. She wants her average to be 81 for her 5 tests, so she needs to score 405 points in total. This means she needs to score a total of 405-257= 148 points in her next 2 tests. Since the maximum score she can get on one of her 2 tests is 100, the least possible score she can get is {(A)48. Note: You can verify that {48 is the right answer because it is the lowest answer out of the 5. Since it is possible to get 48, we are guaranteed that that is the right answer.\n\nWe can compare each of the scores with the average of 81: 76 arrow -5, 94 arrow +13, 87 arrow +6, 100 arrow +19; So the last one has to be -33 (since all the differences have to sum to 0), which corresponds to 81-33 = {48.\n\nWe know that she scored 76, 94, and 87 points on her first 3 tests for a total of 257 points and that she wants her average to be 81 for her 5 total tests. Therefore, she needs to score a total of 405 points. In addition, one of the final 2 tests needs to be the maximum of 100 points, to make the final test score—the one that we are looking for—the lowest score possible for her to earn. We can now see here that the sum of 76+94+100 has a units digit of 0 and that the final test score must have a units digit ending with a 5. Now, 87 needs to be added to a number that makes the sum divisible by 5. Among the answer choices of 48, 52, 66, 70, and 74, only {(A)48 has a units digit that works.

Finally, she gives 25% of what's left to her brother, so she has (0.75*0.72) {(E)54 of what she had in the beginning left.\n\nWOLG, suppose that Gilda has 100 marbles. Then, she gives Pedro 20% of 100, which equals 20, leaving her with 80 marbles. Out of 80 marbles, she gives 10% of 80, which is 8 to Ebony. Thus, she remains with 72 marbles. Then, she gives 25% of 72, which equals 18 to Jimmy, finally leaving her with 54. And, 54{100=54%={(E)54. phoenixfire\n\n(Only if you have lots of time do it this way) Since she gave away 20% and 10% of what is left and then another 25% of what is actually left, we can do 20+10+25 or 55%. But it is actually going to be a bit more than 55% because 10% of what is left is not 10% of the total amount. So, the only option that is greater than 100% - 55% is {(E)54.",

Therefore, the total distance is 15+x and the total time (in hours) is We can set up the following equation: Simplifying the equation, we get Solving the equation yields x=110, so our answer is {(D)110.\n\nIf he travels 15 miles at a speed of 30 miles per hour, he travels for 30 min. Average rate is total distance over total time so (15+d)/(0.5 + t) = 50, where d is the distance left to travel and t is the time to travel that distance. Solve for d to get d = 10+50t. You also know that he has to travel 55 miles per hour for some time, so d=55t. Plug that in for d to get 55t = 10+50t and t=2 and since d=55t, d = 2·55 =110, the answer is {(D)110.\n\nLet h be the amount of hours Qiang drives after his first 15 miles. Average speed, which we know is 50 mph, means total distance over total time. For 15 miles at 30 mph, the time taken is 1{2 hour, so the total time for this trip would be (1/2) + h hours. For the total distance, 15 miles are traveled in the first part and 55h miles in the second. This gives the following equation: Cross multiplying, we get that 15 + 55h = 50h + 25, and simple algebra gives h=2. In 2 hours traveling at 55 mph, the distance traveled is , which is choice {(D)110. TaeKim",

    "solution": "If you calculate the first few values of the equation, all of the values tend to close to 1{2, but are not equal to it. The answer closest to 1{2 but not equal to it is (B)frac50{99.\n\nRewriting the numerator and the denominator, we get (100! · 98!/2){≤ft(99!)^2. We can simplify by canceling 99! on both sides, leaving us with: 100 · 98!{2 · 99! We rewrite 99! as 99 · 98! and cancel 98!, which gets (B)frac50{99.\n\nAll of the terms have the form k^2-1{k^2, which is <1, so the product is <1, so we eliminate options (D) and (E). (C) is too close to 1 to be possible. The partial products seem to be approaching 1/2, so we guess that 1/2 is the limit/asymptote, and so any finite product would be slightly larger than 1/2. Therefore, by process of elimination and a small guess, we get that the answer is (B)frac50{99.\n\nThe product can be simplified by observing that in each individual fraction, the numerator and denominator contain factors that cancel out with adjacent terms. Specifically, the factor 3 in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the 3 in the denominator of the second fraction, the 4 in the numerator of the second fraction cancels with the 4 in the denominator of the third fraction, and so on. This telescoping cancellation continues throughout the entire product. After all the cancellations, only the first factor of the first fraction, (1/2) , and the last factor of the last fraction, (100/99) , remain. The value of the product is therefore: Thus, the value of the product is: (B) (50/99). -- Rayansh Mankad(SharpWhiz17)",

    "solution": "This isn't finished to another. This gives equality, as each team wins once and loses once as well. For a win, we have 3 points, so a team gets 3×2=6 points if they each win a game and lose a game. This case brings a total of 18+6=24 points. Therefore, we use Case 2 since it brings the greater amount of points, or {(C) 24. Note that case 2 can be easily seen to be better as follows. Let x_A be the number of points A gets, x_B be the number of points B gets, and x_C be the number of points C gets. Since x_A = x_B = x_C, to maximize x_A, we can just maximize x_A + x_B + x_C. But in each match, if one team wins then the total sum increases by 3 points, whereas if they tie, the total sum increases by 2 points. So, it is best if there are the fewest ties possible.\n\nWe can name the top three teams as A, B, and C. We can see that (respective scores of) A=B=C because these teams have the same points. If we look at the matches that involve the top three teams, we see that there are some duplicates: AB, BC, and AC come twice. In order to even out the scores and get the maximum score, we can say that in match AB, A and B each win once out of the two games that they play. We can say the same thing for AC and BC. This tells us that each team A, B, and C win and lose twice. This gives each team a total of 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 6 points. Now, we need to include the other three teams. We can label these teams as D, E, and F. We can write down every match that A, B, or C plays in that we haven't counted yet: AD, AD, AE, AE, AF, AF, BD, BD, BE, BE, BF, BF, CD, CD, CE, CE, CF, and CF. We can say A, B, and C win each of these in order to obtain the maximum score that A, B, and C can have. If A, B, and C win all six of their matches, A, B, and C will have a score of 18. 18 + 6 results in a maximum score of (C) 24\n\nTo start, we calculate how many games each team plays. Each team can play against 5 other teams twice, so there are 10 games that each team plays. So the answer is 10· 3 which is 30 But wait... if we want 3 teams to have the same amount of points, there can't possibly be a team who wins all their games. Let the top three teams be A,B, and C. A plays B and C twice, so in order to maximize the games being played, we can split it 50-50 between the 4 games A plays against B or C. We find that we just subtract 2 games or 6 points. Therefore the answer is 30-6, 24 or (C) 24\n\nLet the top 3 teams be A, B, C and the bottom teams to be D, E, F. There are 2 types of games the winners (A, B, C) can play: Winners vs losers and Winner vs Winner. Case 1: Winner vs Loser For A, it would be AD, AE, AF. We want to maximize this or make A win in all 6 (3×2) games. Therefore, A would get 6×3 points or 18. Case 2: Winner vs Winner There are _3P_2=(3!/1!)=6 games they can play against each other. Since we want each 3 to have an equal amount. Each team should win 2 games and get 6 points. In total, 18+6=(C) 24 RandomMathGuy500\n\nName the teams A, B, C, D, E, and F. As we know that the top three teams, or A, B, and C, tied, we can just focus on one, A. When A plays B or C, we want them to both win one and lose one, maximising the points for both teams. When A plays D, E, or F, we want A to win both times. This adds up to 3+3(top teams)+6+6+6(other teams), which equals 24 points. ParticlePhysics",

All four of these solutions work, so the answer is (D) 4. Further, the equation is a quartic in x, so by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, there can be at most four real solutions.\n\nWe can expand (x^2-5)^2 to get x^4-10x^2+25, so now our equation is x^4-10x^2+25=16. Subtracting 16 from both sides gives us x^4-10x^2+9=0. Now, we can factor the left-hand side to get (x^2-9)(x^2-1)=0. If x^2-9 and/or x^2-1 equals 0, then the entire left side will equal 0. Since the solutions can be both positive and negative, we have 4 solutions: -3,3,-1,1 (we can find these solutions by setting x^2-9 and x^2-1 equal to 0 and solving for x). So, the answer is (D) 4.

Also, y=5 and y=1-x intersect at (-4,5), and we call this line y. It's apparent the only solution to 1-x=1+x is 0. Thus, y=1. y=1-x and y=1+x intersect at (0,1), we call this line z. Using the Shoelace Theorem we get: = So, our answer is {(E)16. We might also see that the lines y and x are mirror images of each other. This is because, when rewritten, their slopes can be multiplied by -1 to get the other.

    "solution": "Suppose the fraction of discount is x. That means (1-x)(1+x)=0.84; so, 1-x^2=0.84, and (x^2)=0.16, procuring x=0.4. Therefore, the price was increased and decreased by 40%, or {(E)40.\n\nLet x be the discount. We can also work in reverse such as (84)((100/100-x))((100/100+x)) = 100. Thus, 8400 = (100+x)(100-x). Solving for x gives us x = 40, -40. But x has to be positive. Thus, x = 40.",

    "solution": "Given the information above, we start with the equation (t/4)+(2t/7) + 15 + x = t, where t is the total number of points scored and x≤ 14 is the number of points scored by the remaining 7 team members, we can simplify to obtain the Diophantine equation x+15 = (13/28)t, or 28x+28· 15=13t. Since t is necessarily divisible by 28, let t=28u where u ≥ 0 and divide by 28 to obtain x + 15 = 13u. Then, it is easy to see u=2 (t=56) is the only candidate remaining, giving x=(B) 11. -scrabbler94 Minor Edits by Wrenmath\n\nWe first start by setting the total number of points as 28, since LCM(4,7) = 28. However, we see that this does not work since we surpass the number of points just with the information given (28·(1/4)+28·(2/7) + 15 = 30 (> 28) ). Next, we can see that the total number of points scored is 56 as, if it is more than or equal to 84, at least one of the others will score more than 2 points. With this, we have that Alexa, Brittany, and Chelsea score: 56·(1/4)+56·(2/7) + 15 = 45, and thus, the other seven players would have scored a total of 56-45 = (B) 11. (We see that this works since we could have 4 of them score 2 points, and the other 3 of them score 1 point.) -aops5234 -Edited by Penguin_Spellcaster",

    "solution": "We use the line-segment ratios to infer area ratios and height ratios. Areas: AD:DC = 1:2 AD:AC = 1:3 [ABD] =([ABC]/3) = 120. BE:BD = 1:2 (midpoint) [ABE] = ([ABD]/2) = (120/2) = 60. Heights: Let h_A = height (of altitude) from {BC to A. AD:DC = 1:2 CD:CA = 2:3 height h_D from {BC to D is (2/3)h_A. BE:BD = 1:2 (midpoint) height h_E from {BC to E is (1/2) h_D = (1/2)((2/3) h_A) = (1/3) h_A. Conclusion: ([EBF]/[ABF]) = ([EBF]/[EBF] + [ABE]) = [EBF] {[EBF]+60, and also ([EBF]/[ABF]) = (h_E/h_A) = 1{3. So, ([EBF]/[EBF] + 60) = 1{3, and thus, [EBF] = (B) 30\n\nDraw X on {AF such that {XD is parallel to {BC. Triangles BEF and EXD are similar, and since BE = ED, they are also congruent, and so XE=EF and XD=BF. AC:AD = 3 implies (AF/AX) = 3 = (FC/XD) = FC{BF, so BC=BF + 3BF = 4BF, BF=BC{4. Since XE=EF, AX = XE = EF, and since AX + XE + EF = AF, all of these are equal to AF{3, and so the altitude of triangle BEF is equal to 1{3 of the altitude of ABC. The area of ABC is 360, so the area of△EBF=(1/3) · (1/4) · 360=(B) 30.\n\nBF{FC is equal to The area of triangle ABE{The area of triangle ACE. The area of triangle ABE is equal to 60 because it is equal to one-half of the area of triangle ABD, which is equal to one-third of the area of triangle ABC, which is 360. The area of triangle ACE is the sum of the areas of triangles AED and CED, which is respectively 60 and 120. So, BF{FC is equal to 60{180=1{3, so the area of triangle ABF is 90. That minus the area of triangle ABE is (B) 30. SmileKat32\n\nLet A[Δ XYZ] = {Area of Triangle XYZ A[Δ ABD]: A[Δ DBC] :: 1:2 :: 120:240 A[Δ ABE] = A[Δ AED] = 60 (the median divides the area of the triangle into two equal parts) Construction: Draw a circumcircle around Δ ABD with BD as is diameter. Extend AF to G such that it meets the circle at G. Draw line BG. A[Δ ABD] = A[Δ ABG] = 120 (Since ABGD is cyclic) But A[Δ ABE] is common in both with an area of 60. So, A[Δ AED] = A[Δ BEG]. Therefore A[Δ AED] ≅ A[Δ BEG] (SAS Congruency Theorem). In Δ AED, let DI be the median of Δ AED, which means A[Δ AID] = 30 = A[Δ EID]. Rotate Δ DEA to meet D at B and A at G. DE will fit exactly in BE (both are radii of the circle). From the above solutions, (AE/EF) = 2:1. AE is a radius and EF is half of it implies EF = radius{2, which means A[Δ BEF] ≅ A[Δ DEI]. Thus, A[Δ BEF] = (B) 30. phoenixfire & flamewavelight\n\nUsing the ratio of {AD and {CD, we find the area of △ADB is 120 and the area of △BDC is 240. Also using the fact that E is the midpoint of {BD, we know △ADE = △ABE = 60. Let M be a point such {EM is parellel to {CD. We immediatley know that △BEM ∼ BDC by 2. Using that we can conclude EM has ratio 1. Using △EFM ∼ △AFC, we get EF:AE = 1:2. Therefore using the fact that △EBF is in △ABF, the area has ratio △BEF : △ABE=1:2 and we know △ABE has area 60 so △BEF is (B) 30. - fath2012\n\nWe know that AD = (1/3) AC, so [ABD] = (1/3) [ABC] = 120. Using the same method, since BE = (1/2) BD, [ABE] = (1/2) [ABD] = 60. Next, we draw G on {BC such that {DG is parallel to {AF and create segment DG. We then observe that △AFC ∼ △DGC, and since AD:DC = 1:2, FG:GC is also equal to 1:2. Similarly (no pun intended), △DBG ∼ △EBF, and since BE:ED = 1:1, BF:FG is also equal to 1:1. Combining the information in these two ratios, we find that BF:FG:GC = 1:1:2, or equivalently, BF = (1/4) BC. Thus, [BFA] = (1/4) [BCA] = 90. We already know that [ABE] = 60, so the area of △EBF is [BFA] - [ABE] = (B) 30. i_equal_tan_90\n\nAD : DC = 1:2, so ADB has area 120 and CDB has area 240. BE = ED so the area of ABE is equal to the area of ADE = 60. Draw {DG parallel to {AF. Set area of BEF = x. BEF is similar to BDG in ratio of 1:2 so area of BDG = 4x, area of EFDG=3x, and area of CDG=240-4x. CDG is similar to CAF in ratio of 2:3 so area CDG = 4/9 area CAF, and area AFDG=5/4 area CDG. Thus, 60+3x=5/4(240-4x) and x=30. EFrame\n\nBecause AD:DC=1:2 and E is the midpoint of BD, we know that the areas of ABE and AED are 60 and the areas of DEC and EBC are 120. [EBF] = (120/4) = (B) 30",

Nivaar\n\nWe can see that the last numbers of each of the sets (even numbers and odd numbers) have a difference of two. So, do the second last ones and so on. Now, all we need to find is the number of integers in any of the sets (I chose even) to get (E) 1010. avamarora\n\nIt is similar to the Solution 1: Rearranging the terms, we get 1+(3-2)+(5-4)+(6-5)...(2017-2016)+(2019-2018), and our answer is 1+1009=(E) 1010. LarryFlora\n\nNote that the sum of consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as a square, namely 1+3+5+7+...+2017+2019 = 1010^2. We can modify the negative numbers in the same way by adding 1 to each negative term, factoring a negative sign, and accounting for the extra 1's by subtracting 1009. We then have 1010^2-1009^2-1009. Using difference of squares, we obtain (1010+1009)(1010-1009)-1009 = 2019-1009 = {1010. SigmaPiE\n\nThe sum of odd numbers can be represented as the number of consecutive odds starting from one, squared. Since 2019 is (2019+1)/2, there are 1010 odd numbers. Therefore, the sum of the odd numbers is The sum of even numbers up to 2018 is calculated by noting that there are 2018/2 = 1009 even numbers. Using the formula for the sum of the first n even numbers, n(n+1), we get The difference between these two sums is Thus, the correct answer is -1009+2019=(E) 1010.",

By the same logic, there are 4 ways for Abby and Bridget to be placed if they are adjacent in the same row: they can swap seats, and the other 4 people can be arranged in 4! ways for a total of 4 × 2 × 4! ways to arrange them.

Thus, the answer is (A) 4.\n\nThe average score is 82 which leads us to suppose that Laila got all 82 points for the tests. We know that Laila got the same points in the first four tests and they are all lower than the last test. Let the first four tests be 81 points, then the last test must be 86 points to keep the average fixed. Continue to decrement the first four tests to identify other possible combinations.

Consequently, our next three values will be 3,1 and 1 if we use the same logic. Therefore, our five-digit number is 85311, so the sum is 8+5+3+1+1=18 (D) 18.",

    "solution": "Let the radius of the large circle be R. Then, the radius of the smaller circles are R2. The areas of the circles are directly proportional to the square of the radii, so the ratio of the area of the small circle to the large one is 14 (R^2{4 is 14 of R^2.) This means the combined area of the 2 smaller circles is half of the larger circle, and therefore the shaded region is equal to the combined area of the 2 smaller circles, which is (D) 1.\n\nLet the radius of the two smaller circles be r. It follows that the area of one of the smaller circles is πr^2. Thus, the area of the two inner circles combined would evaluate to 2πr^2 which is 1. Since the radius of the bigger circle is two times that of the smaller circles (the diameter), the radius of the larger circle in terms of r would be 2r. The area of the larger circle would come to (2r)^2π = 4πr^2. Subtracting the area of the smaller circles from that of the larger circle (since that would be the shaded region), we have Therefore, the area of the shaded region is (D) 1.\n\nThe area of a small circle is (1/2)= π r^2. Solving, we get r = {(1/2π). The radius of the large circle is R=2r. The area of the large circle is πR^2=π(2r)^2=4πr^2=4πfrac{12π=2. Subtract the area of the small circles from the area of the large circle to get the area of the shaded region: 2-1= (D) 1.\n\nSince the smaller circles are equivalent, the area of each of them is 1{2 square unit. Since the diameter of each of the two smaller circles is a radius of the larger circle, their areas must be in a ratio of 1:2. This tells us that the area of the larger circle is double the area of the smaller circle, giving us (1/2) · 2 = (D) 1. aoum",

    "solution": "We can first find the prime factorization of 23,232, which is 2^6·3^1·11^2. Now, we add one to our powers and multiply. Therefore, the answer is (6+1)·(1+1)·(2+1)=7·2·3=(E) 42 Note: 23232 is a large number, so we can look for shortcuts to factor it. One way to factor it quickly is to use 3 and 11 divisibility rules to observe that 23232 = 3 · 7744 = 3 · 11 · 704 = 3 · 11^2 · 64 = 3^1 · 11^2 · 2^6. Another way is to spot the \"32\" and compute that 23232 = 32·(101 + 10000/16) = 32· (101+ 5^4) = 32· 726 = 32 · 11 · 66. A third way to factor it is to observe 23232 = 24000 - 768. Factoring out the 3 gives us 3(8000 - 256). Since 8000 = 2^6 · 5^3 and 256 = 2^8, we have 2^6 · 3 (5^3 - 2^2) = 2^6 · 3 (125-4) = 2^6 · 3 · 121 = 2^6 · 3 · 11^2.",

Then the left 2 boxes on the row above are determined. Then the left 1 box on the row above that is determined Then the right 1 box on that row is determined. Then the right 1 box on the row below is determined. Then the right 1 box on the bottom row is determined, completing the diagram. So the answer is (C) 8.

Since b and c are either 1 or -1, b^3 = b and c^3 = c. This shows that abcd = 1. Therefore either a, b, c, and d are all positive or negative, or 2 are positive and 2 are negative. There are 2 ways where a, b, c, and d are 1 (1, 1, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, -1, -1) There are 6 ways where 2 variables are positive and 2 are negative: (1, 1, -1, -1), (1, -1, 1, -1), (-1, 1, 1, -1), (-1, -1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, -1, 1), and (-1, -1, 1, 1). So the answer is (C) 8.

So, For the lowest layer with 4 blocks, there are 2^4=16 possible combination and half of them will lead a + (or -) on the top. The answer is 16/2=(C) 8. If you notice this rule, you can give the answer whatever how many layers you have. The answer will be 2^{n-1 for the layer with n blocks.\n\nWe can use casework to solve this problem. The only way for the top cell to have a + in it is if the third row of the pyramid (the one with 2 cells) is either -- or ++. First, let's pretend that the third row of the pyramid is ++. The only way for that to happen is if the second row (the one with 3 cells) is --- or +++. Now, let's pretend that the second is +++. That would have 2 possibilities for the first row (the one with 4 cells), ++++ and ----. Next, let's pretend that the second row is ---. That makes two more possibilities for the first row, -+-+ and +-+-. Now, let's pretend that the 3rd row is --, which means that the second row is either -+- or +-+. You will soon find that -+- find 2 possibilities for the first row, -++- or -++-, and 2 possibilities for +-+, --++ and ++--. Together, we find that the answer is 2+2+2+2=(C) 8.",

    "solution": "Looking at the values, we notice that 11-7=4, 9-5=4 and 6-2=4. This means we are looking for a value that is four less than a multiple of 11, 9, and 6. The least common multiple of these numbers is 11·3^{2cdot2=198, so the numbers that fulfill this can be written as 198k-4, where k is a positive integer. This value is only a three-digit integer when k is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, which gives 194, 392, 590, 788, and 986 respectively. Thus, we have 5 values, so our answer is (E) 5.\n\nLet us create the equations: 6x+2 = 9y+5 = 11z+7, and we know 100 ≤ 11z+7 <1000, it gives us 9 ≤ z ≤ 90, which is the range of the value of z. Because of 6x+2=11z+7, then 6x=11z+5=6z+5(z+1), so (z+1) must be a multiple of 6. Because of 9y+5=11z+7, then 9y=11z+2=9z+2(z+1), so (z+1) must also be a multiple of 9. Hence, the value of (z+1) must be a common multiple of 6 and 9, which means multiples of 18 (LCM { of 6, 9). So, let's say z+1 = 18p; then, 9 ≤ z = 18p-1 ≤ 90, so 1 ≤ p ≤ 91/18 or 1 ≤ p ≤ 5. Thus, the answer is (E) 5. LarryFlora\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have that all solutions are in the form x=198k+194 where k Z. Counting the number of values, we get (E) 5}. mathboy282\n\nWe can use modular arithmetic. Set up the equations: x ≡ 2 6, x ≡ 5 9, and x ≡ 7 11. These equations can also be written as x+4 ≡ 0 6, x+4 ≡ 0 9, and x+4 ≡ 0 11. Since x+4 is congruent to numbers 6, 9, and 11, then it must also be congruent to their LCM. Thus, x+4 ≡ 0 198, since 198 is the LCM of 6, 9, and 11. Since these numbers have to be three digits, they can only be 194, 392, 590, 788, and 986. This gives us the answer of (E) 5}. ethancui0529\n\nLet N be the three digit positive integer. N = 6a + 2 = 9b + 5 = 11c + 7. Then, we add four to all sides and write N + 4 = 6(a+1) = 9(b+1) = 11(c+1). Now, we know that N + 4 is divisible by 6, 9, and 11. The LCM of 6, 9, and 11 is equal to 198, so N = 198k - 4. From this, we can figure out that N can be 5 different three digit numbers -- 194, 392, 590, 788, and 986. , the answer is (E) 5}. DY",

    "solution": "We can use analytic geometry for this problem. Let us start by giving D the coordinate (0,0), A the coordinate (0,1), and so forth. {AC and {EB can be represented by the equations y=-x+1 and y=2x-1, respectively. Solving for their intersection gives point F coordinates ≤ft((2/3),1{3right). Now, we can see that △EFC’s area is simply (1/2cdot1){3{2 or 1{12. This means that pentagon ABCEF’s area is (1/2)+(1/12)=7{12 of the entire square, and it follows that quadrilateral AFED’s area is 5{12 of the square. The area of the square is then (45/5)12=9·12=(B) 108.\n\n△ABC has half the area of the square. △FEC has base equal to half the square side length, and by AA Similarity with △FBA, it has (1/1+2)= 1{3 the height, so has 1{12th of the area of square(1{2*1{2*1{3). Thus, the area of the quadrilateral is 1-(1/2)-(1/12)=5{12 of the area of the square. The area of the square is then 45·(12/5)=(B) 108. minor edit by abirgh\n\nExtend AD and {BE to meet at X. Drop an altitude from F to {CE and call it h. Also, call {CE x. As stated before, we have △ABF ∼ △CEF, so the ratio of their heights is in a 1:2 ratio, making the altitude from F to {AB 2h. Note that this means that the side of the square is 3h. In addition, △XDE ∼ △XAB by AA Similarity in a 1:2 ratio. This means that the square's side length is 2x, making 3h=2x. Now, note that [ADEF]=[XAB]-[XDE]-[ABF]. We have [△XAB]=(4x)(2x)/2=4x^2, [△XDE]=(x)(2x)/2=x^2, and [△ABF]=(2x)(2h)/2=(2x)(4x/3)/2=4x^2/3. Subtracting makes [ADEF]=4x^2-x^2-4x^2/3=5x^2/3. We are given that [ADEF]=45, so 5x^2/3=45 x^2=27. Therefore, x= 3 √(3), so our answer is (2x)^2=4x^2=4(27)=(B) 108. moony_eyed Minor Edits by WrenMath\n\nSolution with Cartesian and Barycentric Coordinates: We start with the following: Claim: Given a square ABCD, let E be the midpoint of {DC and let BE AC = F. Then (AF/FC)=2. Proof: We use Cartesian coordinates. Let D be the origin, A=(0,1),C=(0,1),B=(1,1). We have that {AC and {EB are governed by the equations y=-x+1 and y=2x-1, respectively. Solving, F=≤ft((2/3),1{3right). The result follows. Now, we apply Barycentric Coordinates w.r.t. △ACD. We let A=(1,0,0),D=(0,1,0),C=(0,0,1). Then E=(0, 12, 12),F=( 13,0, 23). In the barycentric coordinate system, the area formula is [XYZ]=vmatrix x_1 &y_1 &z_1 x_2 &y_2 &z_2 x_3& y_3 & z_3 {vmatrixcdot [ABC] where △XYZ is a random triangle and △ABC is the reference triangle. Using this, we find that Let [FEC]=x so that [ACD]=45+x. Then, we have (x/x+45)= 16 x=9, so the answer is 2(45+9)={108. Note: Please do not learn Barycentric Coordinates for the AMC 8.",

    "solution": "Choose side \"lengths\" a,b,c for the triangle, where \"length\" is how many vertices of the octagon are skipped between vertices of the triangle, starting from the shortest side, and going clockwise, and choosing a=b if the triangle is isosceles: a+b+c=5, where either [a≤ b and a < c] or [a=b=c (but this is impossible in an octagon)]. Options are: a=0 with b,c in 0,5 ; 1,4 ; 2,3 ; 3,2 ; 4,1 , and a=1 with 1,3 ; 2,2. 5{7 of these have a side with length 1, which corresponds to an edge of the octagon. So, our answer is (D) 57\n\nWe will use constructive counting to solve this. There are 2 cases: Either all 3 points are adjacent, or exactly 2 points are adjacent. If all 3 points are adjacent, then we have 8 choices. If we have exactly 2 adjacent points, then we will have 8 places to put the adjacent points and 4 places to put the remaining point, so we have 8·4 choices. The total amount of choices is 8 3 = 8·7. Thus, our answer is (8+8·4/8·7)= (1+4/7)=(D) 57.\n\nWe can decide 2 adjacent points with 8 choices. The remaining point will have 6 choices. However, we have counted the case with 3 adjacent points twice, so we need to subtract this case once. The case with the 3 adjacent points has 8 arrangements, so our answer is (8·6-8/{8 3 )=(8·6-8/8 · 7 · 6 ÷ 6Longrightarrow{(D) ) 57.\n\nWe begin by finding the total number of triangles that can be formed from the 8 vertices of a regular octagon. This is simply So there are 56 possible triangles. We want the probability that a randomly chosen triangle has at least one side that is also a side of the octagon.\n\nFirstly, we calculate the amount of all possible triangles. It is C_8^3=56. Then, we consider how many triangles have at least a edge which is also the edge of octagon. If the triangle shares only one edge with the octagon, fix an edge, we can choose 4 different vertices for the triangle. Thus, there are 8× 4=32 possible triangles. If the triangle shares its two edges with the octagon, obviously, there are only 8 possible triangles. (32+8/56)=(D)frac5{7.\n\nWe split into two cases: Case 1: Exactly one side is chosen. There are 4 lines that each contain 1 side of the octagon, and there are 8 points on the octagon. Thus, the total number of such lines is: align 8 · 4 &= 32. align Case 2: Exactly two sides are chosen. The number of ways to choose 2 points on the octagon is: align 81 &= 8. align Adding the results from both cases, the total is: align 32 + 8 &= 40. align This is the numerator. To find the denominator we do C_8^3=56. Thus, our final answer is 40/56= (D)frac5{7. -jb2015007 -FrankensteinQuixoteCabin",

    "solution": "Note that EJCI is a rhombus by symmetry. Let the side length of the cube be s. By the Pythagorean theorem, EC= s 3 and JI= s 2. Since the area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals, the area of the cross section is s^2 6{2. This gives R = 62. Thus, R^2 = (C) (3/2).\n\nThis time, instead of using a variable like we did in Solution 1, s, for the side length as in the above solution, choose an easy value for s such as 2. In the above solution, s^2 cancels out in the end, so ultimately the answers are equivalent. Technodoggo\n\nWe can simply plug in values and find R to eliminate the variables and avoid the complicated algebra. Let’s assume the side length of the cube is 4 . The given figure is a rhombus because all its sides are equal, but the angles are not 90^° . To find the area of the rhombus, we need to calculate the lengths of the two diagonals. The formula for the space diagonal of a cube is √(3)s , so CE = 4√(3) . By symmetry, IJ = BD = 4√(2) . Now, we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is the product of the diagonals divided by 2: align* Area &= 4√(3) · 4√(2)2 \\\\ &= 8√(6). align* Next, the area of one of the cube’s faces is simply 4^2 = 16 . So, R is: ≤ft(86{16right)^2= (C)frac{3{2. -jb2015007 (Minor edits by FrankensteinQuixoteCabin)",

    "solution": "Directly calculating: We evaluate both the top and bottom: 40320{36. This simplifies to {(B)1120.\n\nIt is well known that the sum of all numbers from 1 to n is n(n+1){2. Therefore, the denominator is equal to (8 · 9/2) = 4 · 9 = 2 · 3 · 6. Now, we can cancel the factors of 2, 3, and 6 from both the numerator and denominator, only leaving 8 · 7 · 5 · 4 · 1. This evaluates to {(B)1120.\n\nFirst, we evaluate 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 to get 36. We notice that 36 is 6 squared, so we can factor the denominator like 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5 · 6 · 7 · 8{6 · 6 then cancel the 6s out to get 4 · 5 · 7 · 8{1. Now that we have escaped fraction form, we multiply 4 · 5 · 7 · 8. Multiplying these, we get {(B)1120. megaboy6679 for minor edits",

We know the number of yellow marbles is (5/12)x - 6 and a positive integer. Therefore, 12 must divide x. Trying the smallest multiples of 12 for x, we see that when x = 12, we get there are -1 yellow marbles, which is impossible. However when x = 24, there are (5/12) · 24 - 6 = (D) 4 yellow marbles, which must be the smallest possible.\n\nSince 1{3 of the marbles are blue and 1{4 are red, it is clear that the total number of marbles must be divisible by 12. If there are 12 marbles, then 4 are blue, 3 are red, and 6 are green, meaning that there are -1 yellow marbles. This is impossible. Trying the next multiple of 12, 24, we find that 8 are green, 6 are red, and 6 are green, meaning that the minimum number of yellow marbles is (D) 4. cxsmi",

Each square on the diagonal corresponds to one square of horizontal/vertical distance (because it's a square). So, we figure out the length of each separate diagonal, multiply by two, and then add 1.

Zoe got (90x/100) + (ax/100) = 186x{100 problems right out of 2x. Therefore, Zoe got (186x/100)2x = (93/100) = (C) 93 percent of the problems correct.\n\nAssume the total amount of problems is 100 per half homework assignment since we are dealing with percentages, not values. Then, we know that Chloe got 80 problems correct by herself and got 176 problems correct overall. We also know that Zoe had 90 problems she did correctly alone. We can see that the total amount of correct problems Chloe and Zoe did together was 176-80=96. Therefore, Zoe did 96+90=186 problems out of 200 problems correctly. This is (C) 93 percent.\n\nIn the problem, we can see that Chloe solved 80% of the problems she solved alone, but 88% of her answers are correct. If 80 and another number's average is 88, the other number must be 96. Then, Zoe solved 90% of the problems she did alone, but 96% of her answers were correct. Then, the average of 90 and 96 is (C) 93.\n\n(Slightly different Solution) Suppose we said that there were 100 problems in their assignment. Then, Chloe had 40 correct and 10 incorrect on her portion, and 48 correct and 2 incorrect on the portion she and Zoe solved. Zoe has 45 correct and 5 incorrect on her portion, and 48 correct and 2 incorrect on the portion that she and Chloe solved. Then, Zoe has 48 + 45 = 93 correct answers out of 100, so the answer is (C) 93. -HW73\n\nLet the total number of problems be t. Let the percentage of the number of problems that Chloe and Zoe did together and got right be x. As we can see, Chloe got 80% of 1{2 of the total problems right, hence, {0.80 · (1/2)t . We also know that Chloe got 88% of t problems right altogether, making it {0.88 · t total problems right. If we add x to the percentage of correct problems that Chloe solved alone, then that should be equal to the total number of problems that Chloe got right, making the equation: 0.80 · (1/2)t + x = {0.88 · t. Solving that, we get x = 0.48t. We also know that Zoe got 90% of 1{2 of the total problems right, making it {0.90 · (1/2)t. We now add that amount to the percentage of problems that Chloe and Zoe got right together, making 0.90 · (1/2)t+ 0.48t. Solving that, we get 0.93t, which is equal to 93%; hence, (C) 93. -fn106068",

    "solution": "There are three different kinds of paths that are on this diagram. The first kind is when you directly count A, M, C in a straight line. The second is when you count A, turn left or right to get M, then go up or down to count 8 and C. The third is the one where you start with A, move up or down to count M, turn left or right to count C, then move straight again to get 8. There are 8 paths for each kind of path, making for 8 · 3={(D)24 paths.\n\nWe can do this problem by computing how many ways there are to get to each letter (in order). There is 1 way to get to the A in the center. We can only get to each of the other Ms by going there from the A, so there is 1 way to get to each of the four Ms. For the Cs, we notice that four Cs are surrounded by one M, and four Cs are surrounded by two Ms. Finally, each of the 8s is surrounded by one C with one way to get there and one C with two ways to get there. Therefore, there are three paths to any of the 8s. Since there are eight 8s, the answer is 3 · 8 = (D)24.",

    "solution": "We know that the perimeters of the two small triangles are 3+CD+AD and 4+BD+AD. Setting both equal and using BD+CD = 5, we have BD = 2 and CD = 3. Now, we simply have to find the area of △ABD. Since (BD/CD) = 2{3, we must have ([ABD]/[ACD]) = 2/3. Combining this with the fact that [ABC] = [ABD] + [ACD] = (3·4/2) = 6, we get [ABD] = (2/5)[ABC] = (2/5) · 6 = (D) (12/5).\n\nSince {AC is 1 less than {BC, {CD must be 1 more than {BD to equate the perimeter. Hence, BD+BD+1=5, so BD=2. Therefore, the area of △ABD is ((2)(4)( B)/2)=4((3/5))=(D) (12/5) megaboy6679",

This equation gives us A = (4 · 6/2) = (24/2) =(A) 12.\n\nA triangle with the same height and base as a rectangle is half of the rectangle's area. This means that a triangle with half of the base of the rectangle and also the same height means its area is one quarter of the rectangle's area. Therefore, we get (48/4) =(A) 12.\n\nA triangle is half of a rectangle. So since M is the midpoint of DA, we can see that triangle DAC is half of the whole rectangle. And it is also true that triangle MAC is half of triangle DAC, so triangle MAC would just be 1/4 of the whole rectangle. Since the rectangle's area is 48, 1/4 of 48 would be 12.

    "solution": "When Cheenu was a boy, he could run 15 miles in 3 hours and 30 minutes = 3×60 + 30 minutes = 210 minutes, thus running (210/15) = 14 minutes per mile. Now that he is an old man, he can walk 10 miles in 4 hours = 4 × 60 minutes = 240 minutes, thus walking (240/10) = 24 minutes per mile. Therefore, it takes him {(B)10 minutes longer to walk a mile now compared to when he was a boy. CHECKMATE2021\n\nFrom the question, the old man can travel five miles in two hours, so we can set both speeds to 15 miles. We can see that Cheenu as an old man takes 2 hours and 30 minutes for him to travel 15 miles, which is also 150 minutes. We can then divide this by fifteen, which gives us 10, thus the answer is B) 10",

Since there is a remainder of 1 when N is divided by 9, the multiple of 9 must end in a 2 for it to have the desired remainder±od 10. We now look for this one: 9(1)=9 9(2)=18 9(3)=27 9(4)=36 9(5)=45 9(6)=54 9(7)=63 9(8)=72 The number 72+1=73 satisfies both conditions. We subtract the biggest multiple of 11 less than 73 to get the remainder. Thus, 73-11(6)=73-66=(E) 7. CHECKMATE2021\n\nWe know that the number has to be one more than a multiple of 9, because of the remainder of one, and the number has to be 3 more than a multiple of 10, which means that it has to end in a 3. Now, if we just list the first few multiples of 9 adding one to the number we get: 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91. As we can see from these numbers, the only one that has a three in the units place is 73, thus we divide 73 by 11, getting 6 R7, hence, (E) 7. -fn106068 We could also remember that, for a two-digit number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits has to be equal to 9. Since the number is one more than a multiple of 9, the multiple we are looking for has a ones digit of 2, and therefore a tens digit of 9-2 = 7, and then we could proceed as above. -vaisri",

Aqf243\n\nWe can set the number as ab where a is the tens digit and b is the ones digit. So now the equation will be ab+ba=132. a+b has to have a remainder of 2 when divided by 10 so it will be a+b≡ 2 ( 10). We also know a<10 and b<10. So a+b can either be 2 or 12. a+b cannot be 2 because then there will be only 3 numbers that work and that isn't in the answer choice. So a+b=12 . To check this we can do ab+ba=132 which equals to (a+b)0+(a+b)=132 and since we said a+b=12 we get 120+12=132 which is true. So we have a+b=12 and a<10 and b<10.If a is 9 then b=3 and if a=3 then b=9 calculating how many pairs are in between you get 7. So the answer is (B) 7}.\n\nLike similar solutions, we can say that 10a+b is a two digit number, and therefore we have 10a+b + 10b+a = 132 which implies 11a + 11b = 132 which implies a + b = 12 . We then use stars and bars to find out that there are 131 = 13 different possible sums. However, we want to satisfy 0 ≤ a ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 9 , therefore we see that the sums 0+12 , 1+11 , 2+10 , and 12+0 , 11+1 , and 10+2 do not work, and our answer is 13-6= (B) 7}.. Pinotation",

The probability of the first chip being red is 3{5 because there are 3 red chips and 5 chips in total. The probability of the second chip being red is 2{4 because there are now 2 red chips and 4 total chips. The probability of the third chip being red is 1{3 because there are now 1 red chips and 3 total chips. If we multiply these fractions, we get 1{10. To get the answer of 2{5 we need to multiply this product by 4 because there are 4 different draws that these red chips can be chosen on. They can be chosen on the {1st 2nd, 3rd, or 4th draws because if a red chip was chosen on the {5th draw, 2 green chips would have already been chosen. So our answer is 1{10 multiplied by 4 which would leave us with the answer of (B) (2/5). ThatCarGuy3",

    "solution": "The area of trapezoid CBFE is 1+32· 4=8. Next, we find the height of each triangle to calculate their area. The two non-colored isosceles triangles are similar, and are in a 3:1 ratio by AA similarity (alternate interior and vertical angles) so the height of the larger is 3, while the height of the smaller one is 1. Thus, their areas are 1/2 and 9/2. Subtracting these areas from the trapezoid, we get 8-1/2-9/2 =3.

    "solution": "We know that out of PQRST, QRS is divisible by 5. Therefore S is obviously 5 because QRS is divisible by 5. So we now have PQR5T as our number. Next, let's move on to the second piece of information that was given to us. RST is divisible by 3. So, according to the divisibility by 3 rule, the sum of RST has to be a multiple of 3. The only 2 big enough are 9 and 12 and since 5 is already given. The possible sums of RT are 4 and 7. So, the possible values for R are 1,3,4,3 and the possible values of T are 3,1,3,4. So, using this we can move on to the fact that PQR is divisible by 4. So, using that we know that R has to be even so 4 is the only possible value for R. Using that we also know that 3 is the only possible value for 3. So, we have PQRST = PQ453 so the possible values are 1 and 2 for P and Q. Using the divisibility rule of 4 we know that QR has to be divisible by 4. So, either 14 or 24 are the possibilities, and 24 is divisible by 4. So the only value left for P is 1. P={(A)1. CHECKMATE2021\n\nWe can simply try each of the answer choices, and we will see which one works. Trying P=(A) 1, if PQR is divisible by 4, QR must be divisible by four. Therefore, QR can only be 24, 52, or 32. However, since QRS is divisible by 5, S = 5, so QR cannot be 52. When QR = 32, R = 2, the last requirement cannot be satisfied because R + S + T = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11, and 11 is not divisible by 3. However, when QR = 24, R = 4, the last requirement can be satisfied. Hence, we can see that when P=(A) 1, there is one way to satisfy all three requirements, leading to a conclusion that P is (A) 1. Bloggish Minor Edits by Wrenmath",

    "solution": "First, we drop a perpendicular, shown above, to the base of the triangle, cutting the triangle into two congruent right triangles. This triangle is isosceles, which means perpendiculars are medians and vice versa. The base of the resulting right triangle is 8 for both sides, and the height is 15, as given. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse, or 17. Using the two legs of the right triangle, we find the area of the right triangle, 60. 60{17 times 2 results in the radius, which is the height of the right triangle when using the hypotenuse as the base. Hence, the answer is (B) frac120{17. Note — There are several other following solutions below that use similar methods of finding the area two different ways shown in this solution. Try to eliminate any words (such as 'can' or 'would be') that make your solution less concise. Try to write 'sure of yourself.'\n\nLet us draw altitude CD. This cuts our base into line segments with length (16/2)=8. Finding the area of the resulting triangles gives [△ADC] = [△BDC] = (8 · 15/2) = 60. Since m∠CDB = m∠CDA = 90^°, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find length AC: Thus we have AC=BC=17. Letting 17 be the base of the triangle makes our height the radius of the semicircle: Let r be the radius of the semicircle. Then we have (17 · r/2)=60 17 · r = 120 (17r/17) = (120/17) r = (B) dfrac120{17. Remember: Area can help in places where you least expect it!",

The shaded region consists of 3 of these equal parts plus half of another, so the fraction of the octagon that is shaded is (1/8)+(1/8)+(1/8)+(1/16)=(D) dfrac7{16.\n\nThe octagon has been divided up into 16 identical triangles (and thus they each have equal area). Since the shaded region occupies 7 out of the 16 total triangles, the answer is (D)(7/16). -Flare\n\nFor starters, what I find helpful is to divide the whole octagon up into triangles as shown here: Now, it is just a matter of counting the larger triangles. Remember that △BOX and △XOA are not full triangles and are only half for these purposes. We count it up and we get a total of 3.5{8 of the shape shaded. We then simplify it to get our answer of (D)(7/16).\n\nWe can divide the octagon into 8 parts and pretend that the area is 64. We know that X is the midpoint of BA and that each space between two points is 8 because 64/8=8. This means that BX=4 because 8/2=4. Then, we add that to 3*8 because there are 3 spaces between points that are each 8. After that, you turn it into a fraction, 28/64, and simplify to get (D)(7/16).",

    "solution": "(This solution is similar to Solution 2.) Let's make this a problem with boxes. In total, there are 9 products derived from these numbers (because 3 numbers per box). This would be our denominator. Every time a spinner lands on 2, we get an even product. These are (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), and finally (3,2). Going back, we see there are 3·3=9 possible combinations, and we have 5 evens, the final answer is (E) frac5{9.\n\nYou can also make this problem into a spinner problem. You have the first spinner with 3 equally divided sections: 1, 2, and 3. You make a second spinner that is identical to the first, with 3 equal sections of 1,2, and 3. If the first spinner lands on 1, it must land on two for the result to be even. You write down the first combination of numbers: (1,2). Next, if the spinner lands on 2, it can land on any number on the second spinner. We now have the combinations of (1,2) ,(2,1), (2,2), and (2,3). Finally, if the first spinner ends on 3, we have (3,2). Since there are 3·3=9 possible combinations, and we have 5 evens, the final answer is (E) frac5{9.\n\nWe can also list out the numbers. Box A has chips 1, 2, and 3, and Box B also has chips 1, 2, and 3. Chip 1 (from Box A) could be with 3 partners from Box B. This is also the same for chips 2 and 3 from Box A. 3+3+3=9 total sums. Chip 1 could be multiplied with 2 other chips to make an even product, just like chip 3. Chip 2 can only multiply with 1 chip. 2+2+1=5. The answer is (E) frac5{9.\n\nHere is another way: Let's start by finding the denominator: Total choices. There are 3 chips we can choose from in the 1st box, and 3 chips we can choose from in the 2nd box. We do 3*3, and get 9. Now - to find the numerator: Desired choices. To get an even number, we need to pick 2 from at least one of the boxes. There are 2 choices as to finding which box we will draw the 2 from. Then, we have 3 choices from the other box to pick any of the other chips, 1, 2, and 3. (3 ·2/9) = 6{9 However, we are over counting the (2,2) configuration twice, and so, we subtract that one configuration from our total. (6/9) - 1{9. Thus, our answer is (E) frac5{9. del-math.\n\nThis might take longer to solve, but you definitely will have the right answer. You first list out all the possible combinations regardless if the product is even or odd. 1 · 1 = 1. 1 · 2 = 2. 1 · 3 = 3. 2 · 1 = 2. 2 · 2 = 4. 2 · 3 = 6. 3 · 1 = 3. 3 · 2 = 6. 3 · 3 = 9. There are 9 possible combinations and 5 of the combinations’ products are even. So, our answer is (E) frac5{9. MiracleMaths\n\nWe can use complementary counting to solve this problem. If we want to find the number of ways for the product to be odd, then the chip chosen from either box has to be 1 or 3. Since there are 2 ways out of 3 to pick an even chip from a box, the probability of picking an even chip from a box is 2{3. Since there are 2 boxes, we can find that the answer is (2/3cdot{2){3= (E) frac5{9. JQTX941016",

On day 1, she sells 1 widget, on day 2, she sells 3 widgets, on day 3, she sells 5 widgets, and so on. This sequence can be described by the first term a = 1 and the common difference d = 2 . Step 1: Find the number of widgets sold on day 20 The formula for the n -th term of an arithmetic sequence is: For n = 20 : So, Janabel sells 39 widgets on day 20. Step 2: Calculate the total number of widgets sold in 20 days} The sum S_n of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by: For n = 20 : Therefore, the total number of widgets sold after 20 days is: (40·10)=(D)400 GeometryMystery\n\nFirst, we have to find how many widgets she makes on Day 20. We can write the linear equation y=-1+2x to represent this situation. Then, we can plug in 20 for x: y=-1+2(20) -- y=-1+40 -- y=39. The sum of 1,3,5, ... 39 is ((1 + 39)(20)/2)= (D)400.\n\nWe can easily find out she makes 2·20-1 = 39 widgets on Day 20. Then, we make the sum of 1,3, 5, ... ,35,37,39 by adding in this way: (1+39)+(3+37)+(5+35)+...+(19+21), which include 10 pairs of 40. So, the sum of 1,3,5, ...39 is (40·10)=(D)400. --LarryFlora",

    "solution": "Let: A be the number of students who voted in favor of the first issue, B be the number of students who voted in favor of the second issue, A B be the number of students who voted in favor of both issues. We are given: A = 149 B = 119 29 students voted against both issues, so the number of students who voted for at least one issue is: By the principle of inclusion and exclusion: Substitute known values:\n\nWe can see that this is a Venn Diagram Problem. First, we analyze the information given. There are 198 students. Let's use A as the first issue and B as the second issue. 149 students were for A, and 119 students were for B. There were also 29 students against both A and B. Solving this without a Venn Diagram, we subtract 29 away from the total, 198. Out of the remaining 169 , we have 149 people for A and 119 people for B. We add this up to get 268 . Since that is more than what we need, we subtract 169 from 268 to get (D)99. Note: One could use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion in a similar way to achieve the same result. cxsmi (note)\n\nThere are 198-149=49 students who voted against the first issue. Out of these, 49-29=20 voted for the second issue. We also find that 50 students voted against the second issue but in favor of the first in a similar way. This means that 149-50=119-20=(D)99 students voted in favor of both issues.",

    "solution": "For starters, we identify d as distance and v as velocity (speed) Writing the equation gives us: (d/v)=1{3 and (d/v+18)=1{5. This gives d=(1/5)v+3.6=(1/3)v, which gives v=27, which then gives d=(D)9.\n\nd = rt, d=(1/3) × r = (1/5) × (r + 18) (r/3) = (r/5) + 18{5 10r = 270 so r = 27, plug into the first one and it's (D)9 miles to school.\n\nWe set up an equation in terms of d the distance and x the speed In miles per hour. We have d=≤ft ((1/3right )(x)=≤ft ({1){5right) (x+18), giving Hence, d=(27/3)=(D)9.\n\nSince it takes 3{5 of the original time for him to get to school when there is no traffic, the speed must be 5{3 of the speed in no traffic or 2{3 more. Letting x be the rate and we know that (5/3)x = x + 18, so we have (2x/3) = 18 miles per hour. Solving for x gives us 27 miles per hour. Because 20 minutes is a third of an hour, the distance would then be 9 miles (D)9.\n\nWhen driving in rush hour traffic, he drives 20 minutes for one distance (1d) to the school. It means he drives 60 minutes for 3 distances (3d) to the school. When driving in no traffic hours, he drives 12 minutes for one distance (1d) to the school. It means he drives 60 minutes for 5 distances (5d) to the school. Subtracting these two situations, it gives us 5d-3d = 18 = 2d, then d=(18/2)=9. So the distance to the school would be (D)9 miles. LarryFlora\n\n(Ratios) requires edits In rush hour traffic, we can create this ratio for each distance we are going to try supposing the distance is d: d : 20 hours In no traffic, we can do the same: d : 12 minutes We want the ratio to be the distance to 60 minutes: d : 20 minutes = 3d : 60 minutes d : 12 minutes = 5d : 60 minutes This shows the speed in miles per hour. This means that the speed in the 2nd ratio has to be 18 faster than the first ratio. We get 3d+18 = 5d · d=9, or (D)9.",

We can fill in the fifth row of the table as shown: We must find the third term of the arithmetic sequence with a first term of 13 and a fifth term of 49. The common difference of this sequence is 49-134=9, so the third term is 13+2· 9=(B) 31.\n\nThe middle term of the first row is (25+1/2)=13, since the middle number is just the average in an arithmetic sequence. Similarly, the middle of the bottom row is (17+81/2)=49.

We multiply these and divide by 2 to find the area of the triangle is √(5 · 20)2=√(100)2=102=5. Since the grid has an area of 30, the fraction of the grid covered by the triangle is 530=(A) frac1{6.\n\nNote angle ∠ACB is right; thus, the area is √(1^2+3^2) × {1^2+3^2times (1/2)=10 × (1/2)=5; thus, the fraction of the total is (5/30)=(A)(1/6).\n\nBy the Shoelace Theorem, the area of △ABC=|(1/2)(15+4+4-1-20-12)|=|(1/2)(-10)|=5.

    "solution": "So, let there be x pairs of 1 socks, y pairs of 3 socks, and z pairs of 4 socks. We have x+y+z=12, x+3y+4z=24, and x,y,z ≥ 1. Now, we subtract to find 2y+3z=12, and y,z ≥ 1. It follows that 2y is a multiple of 3 and 3z is a multiple of 3. Since sum of 2 multiples of 3 = multiple of 3, so we must have 2y=6. Therefore, y=3, and it follows that z=2. Now, x=12-y-z=12-3-2=(D)7, as desired.\n\nSince the total cost of the socks was 24 and Ralph bought 12 pairs, the average cost of each pair of socks is (24/12) = 2. There are two ways to make packages of socks that average to 2. You can have: Two 1 pairs and one 4 pair (package adds up to 6) One 1 pair and one 3 pair (package adds up to 4) Now, we need to solve where a is the number of 6 packages and b is the number of 4 packages. We see our only solution (that has at least one of each pair of sock) is a=2, b=3, which yields the answer of 2×2+3×1 = (D)7.\n\nSince there are 12 pairs of socks, and Ralph bought at least one pair of each, there are 12-3=9 pairs of socks left. Also, the sum of the three pairs of socks is 1+3+4=8. This means that there are 24-8=16 dollars left. If there are only 1 dollar socks left, then we would have 9·1=9 dollars wasted, which leaves 7 more dollars. If we replace one pair with a 3 dollar pair, then we would waste an additional 2 dollars. If we replace one pair with a 4 dollar pair, then we would waste an additional 3 dollars. The only way 7 can be represented as a sum of 2s and 3s is 2+2+3. If we change 3 pairs, we would have 6 pairs left. Adding the one pair from previously, we have {(D)7 pairs.\n\nLet the amount of 1 dollar socks be a, 3 dollar socks be b, and 4 dollar socks be c. We then know that a+b+c=12 and a+3b+4c=24. We can make a+b+c=12 into a=12-b-c and then plug that into the other equation, producing 12-b-c+3b+4c=24 which simplifies to 2b+3c=12. It's not hard to see b=3 and c=2. Now that we know b and c, we know that a=7, meaning the number of 1 dollar socks Ralph bought is (D) 7.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can reduce the price of each sock by 1, resulting in the prices being 0, 2 and 3. This means the total price Ralph spends becomes 24-12×1=12. Now the 0 socks aren't worth anything, but we still need to keep in mind there are at least one of them, so the question becomes: at most 11 of 2 and 3 socks add up to 12. It is obvious that 3×2+2×3=12, so the number of 0 socks (actually 1 socks) is 12-3-2=7. Note: this is very similar to Solution 1, but a non algebraic way of thinking about it. -bbidev",

    "solution": "Clearly, since {FE is a side of a square with area 32, FE = √(32) = 4 {2. Now, since FE = {BC, we have BC = 4 {2. We know that {JB is a side of a square with area 18, so JB = √(18) = 3 {2. Since Δ JBK is equilateral, BK = JB = 3 {2. Lastly, Δ KBC is a right triangle. We see that ∠JBA + ∠ABC + ∠CBK + ∠KBJ = 360^° arrow 90^° + 120^° + ∠CBK + 60^° = 360^° arrow ∠CBK = 90^{°, so Δ KBC is a right triangle with legs 3 {2 and 4 {2. Now, its area is 3 √(2) · 4 √(2)2 = (24/2) = (C)12.\n\nSince FE = {32, and FE = {BC, BC = 4{2. Meanwhile, JB = 3{2, and since △JBK is equilateral, BK = 3{2. If ABCDEF is equiangular, ∠ABC = (180 · (n-2)/n) = 120^{°, where n is the number of sides of the shape. Adding all the angles around B gives 270^{°, so ∠KBC = 360 - 90 = 270^{°. Because △KBC is right, the area of △KBC = 4√(2) · 3√(2) 2 = 12. Therefore, the answer is (C)12. strongstephen Note: Another more complicated way to find out if angle KBC is right, is that we can extend line AB to a point L on triangle KBC. Now, since we know that angle IJB is right, and we know that line IJ now acts as a transversal to lines IJ and AL. That means angle IJB(90 degrees) must be equal to angle JBL by the alternate-exterior angle rule. Since we know that triangle JKB is equilateral, angle JBK will be 60 degrees, hence angle KBL will be 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. Now, we move on to figure ABCDEF. Through the solution above, we know that angle ABC is 120 degrees, so we can use the same line AL which will result in the formation of a linear pair of angles: angles ABC and CBL. Since the angles in a linear pair always add up to 180, and angle ABC is 120, angle CBL = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees. Notice that angle CBL and angle KBL together make up angle KBC. Hence, by the value of 30 degrees derived for angle KBL, angle KBC = angle KBL + angle CBL = 30 degrees + 60 degrees = 90 degrees.",

We'll use 60 as an example here, so we take 60 = 2 · 2 · 3 · 5 or 60 = 2^2 · 3^1 · 5^1. Now, we just add one to the power of each factor. So since we have powers of 2, 1, and 1, we turn those into 3, 2, and 2. Finally, we just multiply them together to get 3 · 2 · 2 = 12 as the amount of factors in 60.\n\nWe know that the number of students in the group has to be a multiple of 15, so we can eliminate A. However, on June 13, they cannot find a new way of organizing the students meaning that the number has only 12 factors. The prime factorization of 60 is equal to 2^2 x 3^1 x 5^1. Using the factor counting formula, we have the add one to each exponent and multiply them together to find the number of factors. (2+1) × (1+1) × (1+1) = 3 × 2 × 2 = 12 factors making (C) 60 the answer. CHECKMATE2021",

    "solution": "The numbers have a sum of 6+5+12+4+8=35, which averages to 7, which means A, B, C, D, and E will have the values 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively. Now, it's the process of elimination: Cup A will have a sum of 5, so putting a 3.5 slip in the cup will leave 5-3.5=1.5; however, all of our slips are bigger than 1.5, so this is impossible. Cup B has a sum of 6, but we are told that it already has a 3 slip, leaving 6-3=3, which is too small for the 3.5 slip. Cup C is a little bit trickier but still manageable. It must have a value of 7, so adding the 3.5 slip leaves room for 7-3.5=3.5. This looks good at first as we have slips smaller than that, but upon closer inspection, we see that no slip fits exactly. And the smallest sum of two slips is 2+2=4, which is too big, so this case is also impossible. Cup E has a sum of 9, but we are told it already has a 2 slip. So, we are left with 9-2=7, which is identical to Cup C and thus also impossible. With all other choices removed, we are left with the answer: Cup (D)D.",

    "solution": "On one team they play 3N games in their division and 4M games in the other. This gives 3N+4M=76. Since M>4 we start by trying M=5. This doesn't work because 56 is not divisible by 3. Next, M=6 does not work because 52 is not divisible by 3. We try M=7 does work by giving N=16 ,M=7 and thus 3× 16=(B)48 games in their division. M=10 seems to work, until we realize this gives N=12, but N>2M so this will not work.\n\n76=3N+4M > 10M, giving M ≤ 7. Since M>4, we have M=5,6,7. Since 4M is 1 ±od{3, we must have M equal to 1 ±od{3, so M=7. This gives 3N=48, as desired. The answer is (B)48.\n\nNotice that each team plays N games against each of the three other teams in its division. So that's 3N. Since each team plays M games against each of the four other teams in the other division, that's 4M. So 3N+4M=76, with M>4, N>2M. Let's start by solving this Diophantine equation. In other words, N=76-4M{3. So 76-4M≡0 ±od{3 (remember: M must be divisible by 3 for N to be an integer!). Therefore, after reducing 76 to 1 and -4M to 2M (we are doing things in ±od{3), we find that M≡1 ±od{3. Since M>4, so the minimum possible value of M is 7. However, remember that N>2M! To find the greatest possible value of M, we assume that N=2M and that is the upper limit of M (excluding that value because N>2M). Plugging N=2M in, 10M=76. So M<7.6. Since you can't have 7.6 games, we know that we can only check M=7 since we know that since M>4, M<7.6, M≡1 ±od{3. After checking M=7, we find that it will work. So M=7, N=16. So each team plays 16 games against each team in its division. Since they are asking for games in it division, which equals 3n = 48. Select (B)48. This might be too complicated. But you should know what's happening if you read the The Art of Problem Solving: Introduction to Number Theory by Mathew Crawford. Notice how I used chapter 12's ideas of basic modular arithmetic operations and chapter 14's ideas of solving linear congruences. Remember: the Introduction Series books by AoPS are for 6th-10th graders! So make sure to read the curriculum books! This goes same for high school students and little kids as well, and especially for those who want to continue on their path of AIME/USA(J)MO. hastapasta",

    "solution": "We can draw a diagram as shown: Let us focus on the 4 big triangles that, together with the inscribed square, fill in the large square. If we zoom in on one of the four triangles, we can see that it is composed of a small unit square in the corner of the large square and two triangles, one smaller than the other. We are going to focus specifically on the smaller of the two triangles. This triangle is similar to the big triangle itself by {AA similarity (because the two sides of a square are parallel. To prove this fact, draw a diagonal of the square and find congruent triangles). Let the shorter leg of the big triangle be x; then (x/x-1)=5-x{1. Thus, x=5-√(5){2, because by symmetry, x < 52. Note that the other solution we got, namely, x=5+ 5 2, is the length of the segment 5-x. x and 5-x together sum to 5, the side of the length of the large square, and similarly, the sum of the solutions is 5. This solution is a result of the symmetry of the problem; if we had set the longer leg of the big triangle to be x, then we would solve the same quadratic to find the same roots, the only difference being that we take the other root. This means the area of each triangle is 5-√(5)2*(5-5-√(5)2)*(1/2)=5{2. Thus, the area of the square is 25-(4*(5/2))=15 (C). Don't use this in a contest scenario, and only use it when practicing math skills. :)\n\nLet us find the area of the triangles and the unit squares: on each side, there are two triangles. They both have one leg of length 1, and let's label the other legs x for one of the triangles and y for the other. Note that x + y = 3. The area of each of the triangles is x{2 and y{2, and there are 4 of each. So now, we need to find 4≤ft((x/2right) + 4≤ft({y){2right). Expanding out the fractions, we get 4≤ft((x/2right) + 4≤ft({y){2right) = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y) = 2(3) = 6. So, the area of the square we need is 25- (4+6) = 15 (C).\n\nProceed as in solution 1 to get x^2 - 5x + 5 = 0. Notice that the side length of the square is {x^2+(5-x)^2 by the Pythagorean Theorem. Thus, the area of the square is",

Solving this equation, we get g=16. There are 16-4=12 boys in our class, and our answer is 16:12=(B)4:3.\n\nTo make the amount of boys and girls equal, 28 - 4 = 24. 24/2 = 12. The girls would need to be 12 + the 4 that we subtracted = 16. The boys would be 12. The ratio of girls to boys would be 16 : 12, but simplified would be 4 : 3. Thus, the answer is 4 : 3. MiracleMaths\n\nWe should be able to divide 28 by the sum of the ratios. If we do guess and check, the only two that complete these conditions is 3:4 and 4:3 since they add up to 7. But, the number of girls has to be more than the boys, so the answer is (B)4:3. AhmetAcreOfLand",

Through transitivity, then, (5· CE/2)=30, and CE=12. Then, using the Pythagorean Theorem, you should be able to figure out that triangleup CDE is a 5-12-13 triangle, so DE={13 , or {(B).\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 5×6=30. Since the parallel line pairs are identical, DC=5. Let CE be x. (5x/2)=30 is the area of the right triangle. Solving for x, we get x=12. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, we have a 5-12-13 triangle. So, the hypotenuse DE has to be {(B).\n\nThis problem can be solved with the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2). We know AB = DC, so DC = 5. CE is twice the length of AD, so CE = 12. 5^2 + 12^2 = c^2. 5^2 = 25. 12^2 = 144. 25 + 144 = 169. 169 has a square root of 13, so the hypotenuse or DE is 13. The answer is {(B). ——MiracleMaths Note: Another way to find out that CE is 12 is by using logic. Since DC = 5, we can reason that the triangle is a 5 - 12 - 13 triangle, because the only Pythagorean Triple with 5 as a leg(not hypotenuse, as that would be the case for a 3 - 4 - 5 right triangle), is 5 - 12 - 13. We know DE is the hypotenuse, so it can’t be 12, which means CE has to be 12, which, in turn, means that DE has to be: 13 {(B).",

    "solution": "We'll just start by breaking cases down. The probability of A occurring is ≤ft((1/2right)^4 = {1){16. The probability of B occurring is ≤ft((1/2right)^4 = {1){16. The probability of C occurring is 4{2cdot ≤ft((1/2right)^4 = {3){8, because we need to choose 2 of the 4 slots to be girls. For D, there are two possible cases, 3 girls and 1 boy or 3 boys and 1 girl. The probability of the first case is 4{1cdot≤ft((1/2right)^4 = {1){4 because we need to choose 1 of the 4 slots to be a boy. However, the second case has the same probability because we are choosing 1 of the 4 children to be a girl, so the total probability is (1/4) · 2 = 1{2. So out of the four fractions, D is the largest. So our answer is (D) 3 are of one gender and 1 is of the other gender.",

To be a multiple of 3, A + B has to be either 2 or 5 or 8... and so on. We add up the numerical digits in the second number; 3 + 2 + 6 + 4 = 15. We then add two of the selected values, 5 to 15, to get 20. We then see that C = 1, 4 or 7, 10... and so on, otherwise the number will not be divisible by three. We then add 8 to 15, to get 23, which shows us that C = 1 or 4 or 7... and so on. To be a multiple of three, we select a few of the common numbers we got from both these equations, which could be 1, 4, and 7. However, in the answer choices, there is no 7 or 4 or anything greater than 7, but there is a 1, so (A) 1 is our answer. Also, you could just look up the answer.

There are a few different sums that can be deduced from the following numbers, which are 24, 30, and 28, all of which represent the three days. Therefore, since Bethany says that the other two people's uniform numbers are earlier, so that means Caitlin and Ashley's numbers must add up to 24. Similarly, Caitlin says that the other two people's uniform numbers are later, so the sum must add up to 30. This leaves 28 as today's date. From this, Caitlin was referring to the uniform wearers 13 and 17, telling us that her number is 11, giving our solution as {(A) 11.",

Both interpretations will arrive at the same result. However, let us stick with the first interpretation for simplicity. Each lane must then be 20 feet wide, so Robert must be riding his bike in semicircles with radius 20 feet and diameter 40 feet. Since the road is 5280 feet long, over the whole mile, Robert rides (5280/40) =132 semicircles in total. Were the semicircles full circles, their circumference would be 2π· 20=40π feet; as it is, the circumference of each is half that, or 20π feet. Therefore, over the stretch of highway, Robert rides a total of 132· 20π =2640π feet, equivalent to π{2 miles. Robert rides at 5 miles per hour, so divide the π{2 miles by 5 mph (because t = d{r and time = distance/rate) to arrive at (B) fracπ{10 hours.",

Therefore, the probability of flipping at least two consecutive heads is (C)frac3{8.\n\nLet's use complementary counting. To start with, the unfavorable outcomes (in this case, not getting 2 consecutive heads) are: TTT, HTH, and THT. The probability of these three outcomes is 1{8, 1{4, and 1{4, respectively. So the rest is exactly the probability of flipping at least two consecutive heads: 1-(1/8)-(1/4)-(1/4)=3{8. It is the answer (C)frac3{8. LarryFlora\n\nWe can list out all the ways to flip a coin three times: HHH,HHT,HTH,THH,HTT,THT,TTH,TTT. Out of them, only HHH,HHT,THH, have at least two consecutive heads. Since there are three ways to flip at least two consecutive heads, and eight total choices, the answer is (C)frac3{8. andliu766",

    "solution": "To find either the LCM or the GCF of two numbers, always prime factorize first. The prime factorization of 180 = 3^2 × 5 × 2^2. The prime factorization of 594 = 3^3 × 11 × 2. Then, to find the LCM, we have to find the greatest power of all the numbers there are; if one number is one but not the other, use it (this is 3^3, 5, 11, 2^2). Multiply all of these to get 5940. For the GCF of 180 and 594, use the least power of all of the numbers that are in both factorizations and multiply. 3^2 × 2 = 18. Thus the answer = 5940{18 = {(C)330.\n\nWe start off with a similar approach as the original solution. From the prime factorizations, the GCF is 18. It is a well known fact that (m,n)× lcm(m,n)=|mn|. So we have, 18× lcm (180,594)=594× 180. Dividing by 18 yields lcm (180,594)=594× 10=5940. Therefore, lcm (180,594)gcf(180,594)=(5940/18)={(C)330.\n\nFrom Solution 1, the prime factorization of 180 = 2^2 · 3^2 · 5. The prime factorization of 594 = 2 · 3^3 · 11. Hence, lcm (180,594) = 2^2 · 3^3 · 5 · 11, and gcf (180,594) = 2 · 3^2. Therefore, lcm (180,594)gcf (180,594) = (2^2 · 3^3 · 5 · 11/2 · 3^2) = 2 · 3 · 5 · 11 = 330 {(C)330",

Then our desired number is x+2. Our integers are x-3,x-2,x-1,x,x+1,x+2, so we have that 6x-3 = 2013 x = (2016/6) = 336 x+2 = {(B)338.\n\nLet the first term be x. Our integers are x,x+1,x+2,x+3,x+4,x+5. We have, 6x+15=2013 x=333 x+5={(B)338.\n\nSince there are 6 numbers, we divide 2013 by 6 to find the mean of the numbers. (2013/6) = 335 1{2. Then, 335 (1/2) + (1/2) = 336 (the fourth number). Fifth: 337; Sixth: {338.\n\nLet the 6th number be x. Then our list is: x-6+x-5+x-4+x-3+x-x-1=2013. Simplifying this gets you 6x-21=2013 6x=2034, which means that x = (B)338.",

Taking the ratio of the amount of slices Peter ate to the amount of slices in the pizza, we find that Peter ate (3/2text slices){12 slices = {(C)(1/8) of the pizza.\n\nAn alternative way of solving this problem is to add the slices separately. When Peter takes a full slice, he takes 1{12 of the pizza. When he shares the slice with paul, he splits a slice of pizza into two, the equation is 1{2 of 1{12, which is 1{24. Adding gives: SmartGrowth edited by megaboy6679\n\nJust like the above solutions, we know that Peter ate 3{2 slices, which is just 1.5 in decimals. There are 12 slices in total, so the fraction would be 1.5{12. To remove the decimal, we can multiply it by 2 to get 3{24 , which is just {(C)(1/8) of the pizza. AhmetAcreOfLand",

The best way to solve this problem is by using casework. There can be only two leading digits, namely 1 or 2. When the leading digit is 1, you can make (3!/2!1!) 3 such numbers. When the leading digit is 2, you can make 3! 6 such numbers. Summing the amounts of numbers, we find that there are {(D)9 such numbers.\n\nNotice that the first digit cannot be 0, as the number is greater than 1000. Therefore, there are three digits that can be in the thousands. The rest three digits of the number have no restrictions, and therefore there are 3! 6 for each leading digit. Since the two 2's are indistinguishable, there are 3·6{2 such numbers {(D)9. Note by algebramaster2: 1 and 2 are the only digits that can be in the thousands place as 0 in the thousands place will not make the number 4 digit anymore.",

So our new expression is 3^{2012. Now we need to look for a pattern in the units digit. 3^1 3 3^2 9 3^3 7 3^4 1 3^5 3 We observe that there is a pattern for the units digit which recurs every four powers of three. Using this pattern, we can subtract 1 from 2012 and divide by 4. The remainder is the power of three that we are looking for, plus one. 2011 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3, so the answer is the units digit of 3^{3+1, or 3^4. Thus, we find that the units digit of 13^{2012 is {(A)1.\n\nIgnore the tens digit of 13, we find a pattern in the units digit that 3^4 1. We also find 2012 can be divided by 4 evenly, which is 2012/4=503. So 3^{2012 = (3^4)^{503. Because the units digit of 3^4 1，so the units digit 1^503 1.

Since the price of the pencils is more than one penny, we can find the price of one pencil (in cents) by taking the greatest common divisor of 143 and 187, which is 11. Therefore, Jamar bought (143/11) 13 pencils and Sharona bought (187/11) 17 pencils. Thus, Sharona bought 17-13 = {(C)4 more pencils than Jamar.\n\nWe find the difference between 1.43 and 1.87 is 1.87-1.43 = 0.44, which is the extra cost of Sharona's pencils than Jamar's pencils. Because the difference between the amounts of the pencils they bought must be divided evenly by 0.44, looking into the answers, 2 or 4 is possibly correct. It gives us the price of each pencil should be 0.44/2=0.22 or 0.44/4=0.11, respectively. Then we find only 0.11 can be divided evenly by 1.43 and 1.87. So the answer is {(C)4",

Solving, we find that the number of teams in the BIG N conference is {(B)7.\n\n(If someone understands what I'm trying to do here and can explain it better, please edit it)We know that every team has to play a game with every other team, so we just need to find out how many consecutive numbers, 1 to x, can fit into 21.

    "solution": "In order to maximize the sum of the numbers, the numbers must have their digits ordered in decreasing value. There are only two numbers from the answer choices with this property: 76531 and 87431. To determine the answer we will have to use estimation and the first two digits of the numbers. For 76531 the number that would maximize the sum would start with 98. The first two digits of 76531 (when rounded) are 77. Adding 98 and 77, we find that the first three digits of the sum of the two numbers would be 175. For 87431 the number that would maximize the sum would start with 96. The first two digits of 87431 (when rounded) are 87. Adding 96 and 87, we find that the first three digits of the sum of the two numbers would be 183. From the estimations, we can say that the answer to this problem is {(C)87431. p.s. USE INTUITION, see answer choices before solving any question -litttle_master\n\nIn order to determine the largest number possible, we have to evenly distribute the digits when adding. The two numbers that show an example of this are 97531 and 86420. The digits can be interchangeable between numbers because we only care about the actual digits. The first digit must be either 9 or 8. This immediately knocks out (A)76531. The second digit must be either 7 or 6. This doesn't cancel any choices. The third digit must be either 5 or 4. This knocks out (B)86724 and (D)96240. The fourth digit must be 3 or 2. This cancels out (E)97403. This leaves us with {(C)87431.\n\nIf we use intuition, we know that the digits will be IN ORDER, to maximze the number. This eliminates (B), (D),and (E). Additionally, the 2 two numbers must have 9 and 8 for the first digit to maximize the sum, eliminating (A). This leaves {(C)87431. -written by litttle_master purely, not copied from anywhere",

Then we need to add these three equations: b+g+r+b+r+g=2(r+g+b)=6+8+4=18. It gives us all of the marbles are r+g+b = 18/2 = 9. So the answer is {(C)9. LarryFlora\n\nLet x be the number of total marbles, r be the number of red marbles, g be the number of green marbles, and b be the number of blue marbles. Then we have x - r = 6, x - g = 8, x - b = 4, and r + g + b = x. Adding the first three equations together, we get 3x - r - g - b = 18 or 3x - (r + g + b) = 18. Substituting in the fourth equation, we have 3x - x = 18 {(C)9. cxsmi",

    "solution": "One way of approaching this is drawing the next circle of boxes around the current square. We can now count the number of black and white tiles; 32 black tiles and 17 white tiles. This means the answer is (D) 32:17.\n\nIf we did not want to draw a diagram though that is probably simpler in this case, we can imagine the last border of black tiles. We see that each side length (if the side length of a square is 1) increases by 2 each time we go out one layer. Therefore, we know that the next border will have a side length of 7. That border has 7^2-5^2=24 black squares in it. The other black border has 3^2-1^2=8 squares in it, so there are 32 black squares in all. The other ones must all be white, so there are 49-32=17 white squares. Thus, we get our answer of (D) 32:17.",

The number of integers is this case is 4·4·3·1=48. Case 2: The last digit is 0. Because 5 is the largest digit, one of the remaining three digits must be 5.

Note that the distance from a corner of the smaller square to the center is equivalent to the circle's radius so the diagonal is equal to the diameter: 2 · 2 · (1/2)=2. The circle's shaded area is the area of the smaller square subtracted from the area of the circle: π - 2. If you draw the diagonals of the smaller square, you will see that the larger square is split 4 congruent half-shaded squares. The area between the squares is equal to the area of the smaller square: 2. Approximating π to 3.14, the ratio of the circle's shaded area to the area between the two squares is about .\n\nFor the ratio of the circle's shaded area to the area between the squares to be 1, they would have to be approximately the same size. For any ratio larger than that, the circle's shaded area must be greater. However, we can clearly see that the circle's shaded area is part of the area between the squares, and is approximately {(A)1/2. Note that this solution is not rigorous, because we still should show that the ratio is less than 3{4.\n\nSet the side length of the bigger square to be 8. Then the area of the big square is 8^2 =64 and the area of the small square (4√(2))^2 = 32, making the difference 32. The area of the circle is 4^2 times π which is 16 π or about 48. Knowing the area of the small square is 32. 48-32 is 16. The area of the big square is 64. So 32/64 is 1/2, or {(A)1/2.",

Next, we set up a proportion: (30/25\\%) = (x/30\\%) to find the number of blue gumdrops. Cross-multiplying, we solve for x: 36 So there are 36 blue gumdrops. We divide the number of blue gumdrops by 2 to get 18 Now, we calculate the number of brown marbles using the proportion: (30/25\\%) = (y/20\\%), where y is the number of brown marbles.

    "solution": "Let the hundreds, tens, and units digits of the original three-digit number be a, b, and c, respectively. We are given that a=c+2. The original three-digit number is equal to 100a+10b+c = 100(c+2)+10b+c = 101c+10b+200. The hundreds, tens, and units digits of the reversed three-digit number are c, b, and a, respectively. This number is equal to 100c+10b+a = 100c+10b+(c+2) = 101c+10b+2. Subtracting this expression from the expression for the original number, we get (101c+10b+200) - (101c+10b+2) = 198. Thus, the units digit in the final result is {(E)8\n\nThe result must hold for any three-digit number with hundreds digit being 2 more than the units digit. 301 is such a number. Evaluating, we get 301-103=198. Thus, the units digit in the final result is {(E)8\n\nSet the units digit of the original number as x. Thus, its hundreds digit is x+2. After the digits are reversed, the hundreds digit of the original number will be the units digit of the new number. Since x-(x+2) = -2, we can do regrouping and \"borrow\" 1 from the tens digit and bring it to the units digit as a 10. Therefore, the units digit will end up as -2 + 10 = {(E)8 Bloggish",

    "solution": "Since all of the exponents are multiples of four, we can simplify the problem by taking the fourth root of each number. Evaluating we get 10^2=100, 5^3=125, and 2^6=64. Since 64<100<125, it follows that (A)2^24<10^8<5^{12 is the correct answer.\n\nFirst, let us make all exponents equal to 8. Then, it will be easy to order the numbers without doing any computations. 10^8 is as fine as it is. We can rewrite 2^{24 as (2^3)^8=8^8. Then we can rewrite 5^{12 as (5^(3/2))^8=(√(125))^8). We take the eighth root of all of these to get {10, 8, √(125). Obviously, 8<10<{125, so the answer is (A)2^24<10^8<5^{12. Solution by Math\n\nWe know that 10^8=(5cdot{2)^8=5^{8cdot2^{8. We also know that 5^12=5^(8+4)=5^{8cdot5^{4. If we remove the common factor of 5^{8 from both expressions, we are left with 2^{8, which equals 256, and 5^{4, which equals 625. So we know that 5^{12 is bigger than 10^{8. Now we need to figure out which is bigger, 10^{8 or 2^{24. To do this, we rewrite 2^{24 as (2^3)^8=(8)^{8, which is clearly less than 10^{8. Therefore, (A)2^24<10^8<5^{12 is the correct answer. By naman14",

We find that the average speed is skewed towards the lower speed, since you spend more time in the lower speed. So, we take the LCM of 40 and 60, getting 120.

From the front, the surface area is half, because if you looked at it straight from the front it would look exactly like a side of A, with a surface area of half. From the back, it is the same thing.

    "solution": "Instead of finding n, we find x=n{3. We want x and 9x to be three-digit whole numbers. The smallest three-digit whole number is 100, so that is our minimum value for x, since if x {Z^+, then 9x {Z^+. The largest three-digit whole number divisible by 9 is 999, so our maximum value for x is (999/9)=111. There are 12 whole numbers in the closed set ≤ft[100,111] , so the answer is {(A)12. - ColtsFan10\n\nWe can set the following inequalities up to satisfy the conditions given by the question, 100 ≤ (n/3) ≤ 999, and 100 ≤ 3n ≤ 999. Once we simplify these and combine the restrictions, we get the inequality, 300 ≤ n ≤ 333. Now we have to find all multiples of 3 in this range for n{3 to be an integer. We can compute this by setting (n/3)=x, where x {Z^+. Substituting x for n in the previous inequality, we get, 100 ≤ x ≤ 111, and there are 111-100+1 integers in this range giving us the answer, {(A)12. - kn07\n\nWe can create a list of the positive integers n that fulfill the requirement of n{3 and 3n are three-digit whole numbers. The first number of this list must be 300 since (300/3) = 100 is the smallest positive integer that satisfies this requirement. The last number of this list must be 333 since 3 · 333 = 999 is the largest positive integer that satisfies this requirement. Since the problem requires n{3 and 3n must be whole numbers, the other numbers must be multiples of 3 (just like 300 and 333), so the list would look like this: To put this list in to a countable form we must put it in a form similar to 1,2,3, . . ., n. So, we manipulate it as follows: Now we can tell that there are 12 positive integers which satisfies the two requirements, so the answer is {(A)12. julia333\n\nWe have to find the range for all numbers first. We can first find the smallest digit in which n{3 is a 3 digit number that 3n is a 3 digit number which is 300{3 = 100, then we find the biggest number in which n{3 is a 3 digit number and 3n is a 3 digit number which is 333{3 = 111. Now we know that all integers from 100 to 111 are possible values and the amount of integer values in that range is {(A)12 (note I divided the numbers by 3 for convenience) twinotter",

Because they are consecutive, one number must be even, and the other odd. Since the sum of an even and an odd number is always odd, and the sum of a and b is less than 100, you can eliminate all answers except for {(C) 79.\n\nFrom the question we can make a^2-b^2 and we can let a be b-1 where a+b<100. First we factor a^2-b^2 to (a+b)(a-b) and then plug in a=b-1 to have: (a+a+1)(a-a+1)=(2a+1)(1)=2a+1=a+b. since a+b will always be an odd number, we can narrow the answers down to (C) and (E). Since 131 would be too big for our range of a+b<100, we would choose {(C) 79. note that this solution would be better if the question was asking for the values of a and b",

Next, the Unicorns win 6 more games and lose 2 more, for a total of 6+2=8 games played during district play. We are told that they end the season having won half of their games, or 0.5 of their games. We can write another equation: (x+6/y+8)=0.5. This gives us a system of equations: (x/y)=0.45 and (x+6/y+8)=0.5. We first multiply both sides of the first equation by y to get x=0.45y. Then, we multiply both sides of the second equation by (y+8) to get x+6=0.5(y+8). Applying the Distributive Property gives yields x+6=0.5y+4. Now we substitute 0.45y for x to get 0.45y+6=0.5y+4. Solving gives us y=40. Since the problem asks for the total number of games, we add on the last 8 games to get the solution {(A)48.\n\nAt the start of the problem we figure out the Unicorns have won 45\\% of their games, which can be represented by 9{20. Since this is a simplified fraction and not necessarily the amount of games they have played, we can add a variable (in this case I am using x) to the numerator and denominator to get 9x{20x. We then know that during the district play they have won 6 more games and lost 2 of them for a total of 6+2=8 games played. We then can add it to our fraction we have built to make 9x+6{20x+8. We also know that the fraction is equal to 1{2. Putting these equations together we get (9x+6/20x+8)=1{2. Now we can cross multiply to come out with 18x+12=20x+8. We now solve for x!18x+12=20x+8 ----> 4=2x ----> 2=x. After we get x which comes out to be 2 we then plug it back into the denominator to get 20(2)+8 which is equal to 48, so the answer must be (A) 48. AM24",

Three radii divide each circle into three congruent regions, with point values shown. The probability that a dart will hit a given region is proportional to the area of the region. When two darts hit this board, the score is the sum of the point values of the regions hit. What is the probability that the score is odd?",
    "options": [],
    "solution": "To get an odd sum, we must add an even number and an odd number (a 1 and a 2). So we have a little casework to do. Before we do that, we also have to figure out some relative areas. You could either find the absolute areas (as is done below for completeness), or apply some proportional reasoning and symmetry to realize the relative areas (which is really all that matters). The area of this entire smaller circle is 9π. The area of each smaller section then must be 9π{3 or 3π. The larger sections trisect a \"ring\" which is the difference of two circles, one with radius 3, the other radius 6. So, the area of the ring (annulus) is 36π - 9π or 27π. The area of each larger section must be 27π{3 or 9π. Note that the area of the whole circle is 36π. One smaller section and two larger sections contain an odd number (that is, 1). So the probability of throwing an odd number is 3π + (2 · 9π) = 21π. Since the area of the whole circle is 36π, the probability of getting an odd is (21π/36π) = (21/36) = 7{12. Since the remaining sections contain even numbers (that is, 2), the probability of throwing an even is the complement, or 1 - (7/12) = 5{12. Now, the two cases: You could either get an odd then an even, or an even then an odd. Case 1: Odd, then even. Multiply the probabilities to get (7/12) · (5/12) = 35{144. Case 2: Even, then odd. Multiply the probabilities to get (5/12) · (7/12) = 35{144. Notice that this is the same. Thus, the total probability of an odd sum is (35/144) · (2/1) = (B) = (35/72).",

We can simplify 45x=30y down to 3x=2y and 45x=20(760-x-y) down to 9x=4(760-x-y). We can then solve the equations accordingly: From the equation 3x=2y, we know that 4y=6x.

    "solution": "Notice that 44 and 38 are both even, while 59 is odd. If any odd prime is added to 59, an even number will be obtained. However, the only way to obtain this even number(common sum) would be to add another even number to 44, and a different one to 38. Since there is only one even prime (2), the middle card's hidden number cannot be an odd prime, and so must be even. Therefore, the middle card's hidden number must be 2, so the constant sum is 59+2=61. Thus, the first card's hidden number is 61-44=17, and the last card's hidden number is 61-38=23. Since the sum of the hidden primes is 2+17+23=42, the average of the primes is (42/3)=(B) 14.\n\nSay that the 3 hidden prime numbers are x, y and z for cards 1, 2, and 3 respectively. x+44 = z+38 = y+59. Therefore z = x +6 and z = y+21. Average of the 3 prime numbers is (x+y+z)/3 = (3z - 27)/3 = z-9. So the average + 9 = prime number. Only (B) 14 satisfies this condition.",

So each folder is 2.50-0.5 = 2.Since Karl bought 5 folders all of the folders after the discount is (5)(2) = 10, and the money bought before the discount is (5)(2.50) = 12.50. To find the money Karl saves all we have to do is subtract 12.50 - 10 = 2.50. Thus the answer is {(C) 2.50.\n\nHaving a 20\\% off sale is equivalent to a \"Buy 4 get 1 free\" sale.

    "solution": "We can use the equation d=rt where d is the distance, r is the rate, and t is the time. The distances he ran and walked are equal, so r_rt_r=r_wt_w, where r_r is the rate at which he ran, t_r is the time for which he ran, r_w is the rate at which he walked, and t_w is the time for which he walked. Because he runs three times faster than he walks, r_r=3r_w. We want to find the time he ran, t_r = (r_wt_w/t_r) = ((r_w)(6)/3r_w) = 2 minutes. He traveled for a total of 6+2={(D)8 minutes.\n\nWe know that it took Joe 6 minutes to walk halfway. If he ran 3 times as fast as that, he went 6/3 = 2 minutes for the other half (as t=d{s and if we multiply s by 3 we are essentially dividing t by 3). Therefore, we have 6 + 2 = 8 minutes.",

We have 3 choices for the second digit, since we already used up one of the digits, and 2 choices for the third, and finally just 1 choices for the fourth and final one. 2*3*2*1 is 12, but there are 2 zeros that have been counted as different numbers, so divide by 2 to get {(B)6.\n\nNote that the four-digit number must start with either a 2 or a 4. The four-digit numbers that start with 2 are 2400, 2040, and 2004. The four-digit numbers that start with 4 are 4200, 4020, and 4002 which gives us a total of {(B)6.\n\nIn order for the resulting numbers to have four digits, they cannot start with 0. Therefore, both zeroes must be in the last three places. There are 32=3 ways to choose which two of the last three places are zeroes. Then there are 2·1=2 ways to arrange the 2 and the 4 in the remaining two places, giving us a total of 3·2={(B)6.",

Bill being the oldest is false (as Amy not being the oldest in the answer choice is also a true statement, but we cannot have two true statements per our conditions), so we can eliminate that answer. Now we know that Bill isn't the oldest and could be the youngest or the second oldest. Don't forget, we have TWO false statements and only one true statement. The second statement where Amy is not the oldest is another false statement. So now we know Amy is the oldest, followed by Celine whom is the second oldest, and Bill, whom is the youngest.Thus, the answer is {(E)Amy, Celine, Bill. --Angela-- (amyxin0316)",

    "options": [],
    "solution": "For her distance to be represented as a constant horizontal line, Tess would have to be running in a circular shape with her home as the center. Since she is running around a rectangle, this is not possible, ruling out B and E with straight lines. Because JL is the diagonal of the rectangle, and L is at the middle distance around the perimeter, her maximum distance should be in the middle of her journey. The maximum in A is at the end, and C has two maximums, ruling both out. Thus the answer is (D).\n\nEven though Solution 1 may find an answer, it is never proven that D actually describes the distance to Tess' home. It may be easier to compare the distance traveled by Tess rather than the time spent, if we suppose that Tess moves at constant speed then the graphs distance-time and distance-position are equivalent. Let x be the linear distance walked by Tess, and d her distance from home J. We will divide this problem into four parts (sections JK, KL, LM and MJ). Section JK: At any point of the segment JK, the distance of Tess from home is described by the function d_JK(x)=x_J where x_J is the linear distance traveled by Tess from point J. Section KL: From K to L, the distance from home is described by a right triangle, where d is the hypotenuse. In this situation the distance follows the function d_KL(x)={JK^2+x_K^2, which is a curve (this was obtained by applying the Pythagorean Theorem). Section LM: Following an analogue reasoning to Section KL, the distance function in this case results d_LM(x)={MJ^2+(LM-x_L)^2 which is also a curve. Section MJ: Analogue to Section JK, we obtain a linear function d_MJ(x)=MJ-x_M None of the shown answers in the multiple choice describe the real distance between Tess and home along the path. The real graph should have a shape of the following kind: Which is slightly different from the expected solution D. FaC7oR",

The central angle formed between 4 and 5 is 30 degrees (since it is 1/12 of a full circle, 360). By 4:20, the hour hand would have moved 1{3 way from 4 to 5 since 20{60 is reducible to 1{3. One third of the way from 4 to 5 is one third of 30 degrees, which is 10 degrees past the 4. Recall that the minute hand is at the 4, so the angle between them is {(D) 10.",

Each square's area represents a side length squared, so the squares on the legs of the right triangle adds to the square on the hypotenuse. This gives 2X+2Y=2Z. Then, dividing by 2 we get X+Y=Z, which is one of the answer choices. Since there can only be one correct answer, and there is already one, we see that the answer must be {(E)X+Y=Z.",

    "solution": "We can try to guess and check to find the answer. If she got five right, her score would be (5*5)-(5*2)=15. If she got six right her score would be (6*5)-(2*4)=22. That's close, but it's still not right! If she got 7 right, her score would be (7*5)-(2*3)=29. Thus, our answer is {{(C)7. avamarora\n\nWe can start with the full score, 50, and subtract not only 2 points for each incorrect answer but also the 5 points we gave her credit for. This expression is equivalent to her score, 29. Let x be the number of questions she answers correctly. Then, we will represent the number incorrect by 10-x.\n\nSuppose she got x questions right. Then she got 10 - x questions wrong. Since she gains 5 points for a correct answer and loses 2 for an incorrect one, we can solve 5x - 2(10 - x) = 29 to get that x = {{(C)7. cxsmi\n\nWe see that Olivia's score is odd. Since subtracting multiples of 2 (even numbers) does not change a number's parity (odd or even), Olivia's score from only her correct answers must be odd. Then, we test odd multiples of 5 greater than 29 to see which one works. The smallest odd multiple of 5 greater than 29 is 35, meaning 7 answers were correct and the remaining 3 answers were wrong. We see that the final score is which is the score Olivia got. Thus, the answer is {(C) 7.",

    "solution": "Since Ott gets equal amounts of money from each friend, we can say that he gets x dollars from each friend.

For this example, we will use 5. Moe gave Ott a fifth of his money, and also five dollars. So in total Moe has 25 dollars. Loki gave Ott a fourth of his money, and also five dollars. So in total Loki has 20 dollars. Nick gave Ott a third of his money, and also five dollars. So in total Nick has 15 dollars. 5·3=15 which is the total money the group gave Ott. 25+20+15=60 is the group's balance.

    "questionText": "I'm thinking of two whole numbers. Their product is 24 and their sum is 11. What is the larger number?",
    "options": [],
    "solution": "Let the numbers be x and y. Then we have x+y=11 and xy=24. Solving for x in the first equation yields x=11-y, and substituting this into the second equation gives (11-y)(y)=24. Simplifying this gives -y^2+11y=24, or y^2-11y+24=0. This factors as (y-3)(y-8)=0, so y=3 or y=8, and the corresponding x values are x=8 and x=3. These are essentially the same answer: one number is 3 and one number is 8, so the largest number is 8, {D.\n\nUse the answers to attempt to \"reverse engineer\" an appropriate pair of numbers. Looking at option A, guess that one of the numbers is 3. If the sum of two numbers is 11 and one is 3, then other must be 11 - 3 = 8. The product of those numbers is 3· 8 = 24, which is the second condition of the problem, so our numbers are 3 and 8. However, 3 is the smaller of the two numbers, so the answer is 8 or {D.\n\nWe go through the divisor pairs of 24 to see which two numbers sum to 11. The numbers clearly cannot be negative. If one was negative, then the other must also be negative in order to multiply to a positive product, but it would be impossible for the numbers to add up to a positive sum. So, we look at the positive divisor pairs of 24, namely 1 and 24, 2 and 12, 3 and 8, and 4 and 6. The only pair of numbers that sums to 11 is 3 and 8. The larger number is 8, so the answer is {D.",

    "options": [],
    "solution": "This is equivalent to asking for the probability that at least one of the numbers is a multiple of 5, since if one of the numbers is a multiple of 5, then the product with it and another integer is also a multiple of 5, and if a number is a multiple of 5, then since 5 is prime, one of the factors must also have a factor of 5, and 5 is the only multiple of 5 on a die, so one of the numbers rolled must be a 5. To find the probability of rolling at least one 5, we can find the probability of not rolling a 5 and subtract that from 1, since you either roll a 5 or not roll a 5. The probability of not rolling a 5 on either dice is ≤ft((5/6) ) ≤ft((5/6) )=25{36. Therefore, the probability of rolling at least one five, and thus rolling two numbers whose product is a multiple of 5, is 1-(25/36)=(11/36), {D",

    "solution": "The number 0 has no reciprocal, and 1 and -1 are their own reciprocals. This leaves only 2 and -2. The reciprocal of 2 is 1/2, but 2 is not less than 1/2. The reciprocal of -2 is -1/2, and -2 is less than-1/2, so it is {A.\n\nThe statement \"a number is less than its reciprocal\" can be translated as x < 1{x. Multiplication by x can be done if you do it in three parts: x>0, x=0, and x<0. You have to be careful about the direction of the inequality, as you do not know the sign of x. If x>0, the sign of the inequality remains the same. Thus, we have x^2 < 1 when x > 0. This leads to 0 < x < 1. If x=0, the inequality x < 1{x is undefined. If x<0, the sign of the inequality must be switched. Thus, we have x^2 > 1 when x < 0. This leads to x < -1. Putting the solutions together, we have x<-1 or 0 < x < 1, or in interval notation, (-, -1) (0, 1). The only answer in that range is {{(A)-2\n\nStarting again with x < 1{x, we avoid multiplication by x. Instead, move everything to the left, and find a common denominator: x < 1{x x - (1/x) < 0 (x^2 - 1/x) < 0 ((x+1)(x-1)/x) < 0 Divide this expression at x=-1, x=0, and x=1, as those are the three points where the expression on the left will \"change sign\". If x<-1, all three of those terms will be negative, and the inequality is true. Therefore, (-, -1) is part of our solution set. If -1 < x < 0, the (x+1) term will become positive, but the other two terms remain negative. Thus, there are no solutions in this region. If 0 < x < 1, then both (x+1) and x are positive, while (x-1) remains negative. Thus, the entire region (0, 1) is part of the solution set. If 1 < x, then all three terms are positive, and there are no solutions. At all three \"boundary points\", the function is either 0 or undefined. Therefore, the entire solution set is (-, -1) (0, 1), and the only option in that region is x=-2, leading to {A.\n\nWe can find out all of their reciprocals. Now we compare and see that the answer is {A\n\nLook at each number. Notice that the number must be negative. The number cannot be -1, 0, 1, ... . -2 is all that is left",

Starting at A and going clockwise, the perimeter is: AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FG + GA 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 15, thus the answer is {C\n\nThe perimeter of ABCDEFG is the perimeter of the three triangles, minus segments AD and EG, which are on the interior of the figure. Because each of these segments is on two triangles, each segment must be subtracted two times. As in solution 1, the sides of the triangles are 4, 2, and 1, and the perimeters of the triangles are thus 12, 6, and 3. The perimeter of the three triangles is 12 + 6 + 3 = 21. Subtracting the two segments AD and EG two times, the perimeter of ABCDEFG is 21 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 = 15, and the answer is {C.",

    "questionText": "Consider these two geoboard quadrilaterals. Which of the following statements is true?",
    "options": [],
    "solution": "First consider the area of the two figures. Assume that the pegs are 1 unit apart. Divide region I into two triangles by drawing a horizontal line on the second row from the top. Shifting the bottom triangle up one unit will create a square, and this square has the same area as region I. Thus, region I has an area of 1 square unit. Draw a horizontal line on figure II on the fourth row from the top to divide the figure into two triangles. Temporarily move the top of the higher triangle one peg to the left. This will preserve the area of the triangle, as you are keeping both the height and the base of the triangle equal. Now you have two congruent triangles that are half of the area of a unit square. Thus, region II also has an area of 1 square unit, and the areas are equal. To compare the perimeters, note that region I has two different side lengths: two sides are 1 unit apart, and the other two sides are {2 apart, as they are the diagonal of a unit square. The total perimeter is 2 + 2{2. Note that region II has three different side lengths. One side is a unit length, while two sides are {2. For the perimeters to be equal, the last side must be of unit length. But the last side in region II is clearly longer than 1 unit, so we can say that the perimeter of region II is greater than the perimeter of region I without calculating it. Thus, the correct answer is {E. (The perimeter of region II is 1 + 2√(2) + {5, since the last side is the diagonal of a 2 by 1 rectangle, and can be found with the pythagorean theorem as √(2^2 + 1^2) = {5. This does not need to be found for this problem, as you can do a one-to-one correspondence with three of the four sides of the figure as outlined, and just compare the last remaining side of each figure.)\n\nUsing the Pick’s Theorem, The area of both figures is 1. This rules out answer choices A and B. When using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that the perimeter of I is 2 + 2({2) and the perimeter of II is 1 + 2({2) + {5. Since {5 > 1, the perimeter of II is greater, therefore the correct answer is {E.",

    "questionText": "You have nine coins: a collection of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters having a total value of 1.02, with at least one coin of each type. How many dimes must you have?",
    "options": [],
    "solution": "Since you have one coin of each type, 1 + 5 + 10 + 25 = 41 cents are already determined, leaving you with a total of 102 - 41 = 61 cents remaining for 5 coins. You must have 1 more penny. If you had more than 1 penny, you must have at least 6 pennies to leave a multiple of 5 for the nickels, dimes, and quarters. But you only have 5 more coins to assign. Now you have 61 - 1 = 60 cents remaining for 4 coins, which may be nickels, quarters, or dimes. If you have only one more dime, that leaves 50 cents in 3 nickels or quarters, which is impossible. If you have two dimes, that leaves 40 cents for 2 nickels or quarters, which is again impossible. If you have three dimes, that leaves 30 cents for 1 nickel or quarter, which is still impossible. And all four remaining coins being dimes will not be enough. Therefore, you must have no more dimes to assign, and the 60 cents in 4 coins must be divided between the quarters and nickels. We quickly see that 2 nickels and 2 quarters work. Thus, the total count is 2 quarters, 2 nickels, 1 penny, plus one more coin of each type that we originally subtracted. Double-checking, that gives a total 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 9 coins, and a total of 2· 25 + 2· 5 + 1 + (1 + 5 + 10 + 25) = 102 cents. There is only 1 dime in that combo, so the answer is {A.\n\nIt is clear that there should only be 2 pennies; any more would take up too many coins, and the limit is 9. Now we have 1 left, and 7 coins to use. Looking at the quarters, we can make methodical guesses. If there is 1 quarter, then we would have to make 0.75 with 6 coins. We take a few educated guesses for the nickel and dime combos, and see that 1 quarter will not work. Trying values for 2 quarters, we see that this will not work either. When we reach 3 quarters, the remaining is 0.25 made from 4 coins. We try with 2 dimes, which does not work (it only takes 3 coins) and we try with 1 dime. After trying 2 pennies, 3 quarters, 1 dime, and 3 nickels, it is evident that this combo works. Therefore, the answer is {A It might seem that this solution takes time, but in reality, it can be done very quickly, given ones desire to solve a problem quickly mk",

    "solution": "To quickly solve this multiple choice problem, make the (not necessarily valid, but very convenient) assumption that ABCD can have any dimension. Give the rectangle dimensions of AB = CD = 12 and BC = AD= 6, which is the easiest way to avoid fractions. Labelling the right midpoint as M, and the bottom midpoint as N, we know that DN = NC = 6, and BM = MC = 3. [△ADN] = 1{2cdot 6· 6 = 18 [△MNC] = 1{2cdot 3· 6 = 9 [△ABM] = 1{2cdot 12· 3 = 18 [△AMN] = [ ABCD] - [△ADN] - [△MNC] - [△ABM] [△AMN] = 72 - 18 - 9 - 18 [△AMN] = 27, and the answer is {B\n\nThe above answer is fast, but satisfying, and assumes that the area of △AMN is independent of the dimensions of the rectangle. All in all, it's a very good answer though. However this is an alternative if you don't get the above answer. Label AB = CD = l and BC = DA = h Labelling m and n as the right and lower midpoints respectively, and redoing all the work above, we get: [△ADN] = (1/2cdot h· l){2 = lh{4 [△MNC] = (1/2cdot l){2cdot (h/2) = {lh{8 [△ABM] = (1/2cdot l· h){2 = lh{4 [△AMN] = [ ABCD] - [△ADN] - [△MNC] - [△ABM] [△AMN] = lh - (lh/4) - (lh/8) - lh{4 [△AMN] = (3/8)lh = 3{8cdot 72 = 27, and the answer is {B\n\nLet's assume WLOG that the sides of the rectangle are 9 and 8. The area of the 3 triangles would then be 8·(9/2cdot1){2 = 18, 4·(9/2cdot1){2 = 9, 4· 9·(1/2) = 18. Adding these up, we get 45, and subtracting that from 72, we get 27, so the answer is {B ilee0820",

    "questionText": "Bicycle license plates in Flatville each contain three letters. The first is chosen from the set C,H,L,P,R, the second from A,I,O, and the third from D,M,N,T. When Flatville needed more license plates, they added two new letters. The new letters may both be added to one set or one letter may be added to one set and one to another set. What is the largest possible number of ADDITIONAL license plates that can be made by adding two letters?",
    "options": [],
    "solution": "Using the same logic as above, the number of combinations of plates is simply the product of the size of each set of letters. In general, when three numbers have the same fixed sum, their product will be maximal when they are as close together as possible. This is a 3D analogue of the fact that a rectangle with fixed perimeter maximizes its area when the sides are equal (ie when it becomes a square). In this case, no matter where you add the letters, there will be 5 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 14 letters in total. If you divide them as evenly as possible among the three groups, you get 5, 5, 4, which is a possible situation. As before, the answer is 5 · 5 · 4 - 5 · 3 · 4 = 40, and the correct choice is {D\n\nBefore new letters were added, five different letters could have been chosen for the first position, three for the second, and four for the third. This means that 5· 3· 4=60 plates could have been made. If two letters are added to the second set, then 5· 5· 4=100 plates can be made. If one letter is added to each of the second and third sets, then 5· 4· 5=100 plates can be made. None of the other four ways to place the two letters will create as many plates. So, 100-60={40 ADDITIONAL plates can be made.So the correct choice is {D",

    "solution": "Note that the units digits of the powers of 9 have a pattern: 9^1 = { 9, 9^2 = 8{ 1, 9^3 = 72{ 9, 9^4 = 656{ 1, and so on. Since all natural numbers with the same last digit have the same remainder when divided by 5, the entire number doesn't matter, just the last digit. For even powers of 9, the number ends in a 1. Since the exponent is even, the final digit is 1. Note that all natural numbers that end in 1 have a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. So, our answer is {{(B)1.\n\nWrite 1999 as 2000-1. We are taking (2000-1)^2000 {10. Using the binomial theorem, we see that ALL terms in this expansion are divisible by 2000, which is in turn divisible by 5, except for the very last term, which is just (-1)^{2000. This is clear because the binomial expansion is just choosing how many 2000s and how many -1s there are for each term. Using this, we can take the entire polynomial {10, which leaves just (-1)^2000={{(B)1.\n\nAs 1999 ≡ -1 ±od{5, we have 1999^2000 ≡ (-1)^2000 ≡ 1 ±od{5. Thus, the answer is {{(B)1.\n\nA sum/product of any two natural numbers has the same remainder, when divided by 5, as the sum/product of their remainders. Thus, we can use the basic definition of an exponent and view the problem as 1999 · 1999 · · · 1999. Using the fact stated in the first sentence, we see that the remainder of 1999, when divided by 5, is 4. The problem can now be written viewed as finding the remainder of 4^{2000 when it is divided by 5, which is already much simpler. Now, toying with the simplified problem a little, see notice that powers of 4 alternate from ending in 4 and 6. We notice that even powers of 4 always end in 6, and also that 2000 is even. Thus 4^{2000 must end in 6, which, when divided by 5 gives a remainder of {{(B)1.\n\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, 1999^2000 ≡ 1999^2000 (5-1) ≡ 1999^0 ≡ 1 ±od 5. Thus the answer is {{(B)1.",

    "options": [],
    "solution": "Since △FGH is fairly small relative to the rest of the diagram, we can make an underestimate by using the current diagram. All triangles are right-isosceles triangles. The sum of the shaded regions is (9/2) + (9/8) + (9/32) = (189/32) ≈ 5.9 5.9 is an underestimate, as some portion (but not all) of △FGH will be shaded in future iterations. If you shade all of △FGH, this will add an additional 9{32 to the area, giving (198/32) ≈ 6.2, which is an overestimate. Thus, {{(A)6 is the only answer that is both over the underestimate and under the overestimate.\n\nIn iteration 1, congruent triangles △ABJ, △BDJ, and △BDC are created, with one of them being shaded. In iteration 2, three more congruent triangles are created, with one of them being shaded. As the process continues indefinitely, in each row, 1{3 of each triplet of new congruent triangles will be shaded. The \"fourth triangle\" at the top (△FGH in the diagram) will gradually shrink, leaving about 1{3 of the area shaded. This means (1/3left(1){26· 6) = 6 square units will be shaded when the process goes on indefinitely, giving {A.\n\nUsing Solution 1 as a template, note that the sum of the areas forms a geometric series: (9/2) + (9/8) + (9/32) + (9/128) + ... This is the sum of a geometric series with first term a_1 = 9{2 and common ratio r = 1{4 This is the easiest way to do this problem. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r|<1 is shown by the formula.

However, 100 times is much enough. The answer is (1/3times 6× 6× 1){2 = {(A)6.\n\nBecause all of the triangles are isosceles, this gives us the area of one triangle with side length s, A = (1/2)s^2. Logically, s keeps on getting 1{2 as small as the previous one (3, (3/2), 3{4, etc) Meaning for triangle number n, s = 3((1/2))^n. Putting this into our original equation, A = (1/2)(3((1/2))^n)^2 = (9/2)((1/2))^2n = 9((1/2))^{2n+1 This means the total area is 9^_n=1 (1/2)^{2n+1, using exponent laws, we can simplify this to (9/2) ^_n=1 (1/4)^n. The formula for a geometric series like this is ^_n=1 a*r^n = a{1-r. Using this, we get (9/2)(4/4)-(1/4) = (9/2times4){3 = 3×2 = {(A)6.

Repeat this process by putting smaller triangles into the corner of the square and eventually, you should see that this converges to just 1{4 of the square. △BCD is 1{2 of the square and rest of the triangles make 1{4 which totals to 3{4 of the square. Square BCDJ has side length 3 so it's area is 9, and 3{4 of 9 is {(A)6. RandomMathGuy500\n\nAs in Solution 3, the area form the geometric series (9/2) + (9/8) + (9/32) + (9/128) + .... If this is x, than 4x is 18 + (9/2) + (9/8) + (9/32) + (9/128) + ....Than we take away x to get 3x = 18. When we solve for x we get x = 6, so the correct answer is {A.",
