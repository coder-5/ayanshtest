# Implementation Status Report
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Branch**: main

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Code Cleanup (COMPLETED)

### Deleted Unused Code (~2,100 lines removed):
1. ‚úÖ **Diagram Generation** (1,057 lines)
   - `lib/diagram-engine/AdvancedDiagramEngine.ts` (458 lines)
   - `lib/diagram-engine/Geometry3D.ts` (312 lines)
   - `lib/ai-diagram/DiagramGenerator.ts` (287 lines)
   - **Reason**: You'll provide all diagrams manually

2. ‚úÖ **Performance Monitoring** (167 lines)
   - `lib/performance.ts`
   - **Reason**: Unnecessary for local single-user application

3. ‚úÖ **Request Deduplication** (145 lines)
   - `lib/request-deduplication.ts`
   - **Reason**: React Query/SWR would be better if needed

4. ‚úÖ **Query Optimization** (203 lines)
   - `lib/query-optimization.ts`
   - **Reason**: Premature optimization, add later if needed

5. ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting** (11 files modified)
   - Removed `lib/rateLimit.ts`
   - Removed rate limiting from all API routes
   - **Reason**: Unnecessary for single-user local app

6. ‚úÖ **Error Report Component** (3 files)
   - `components/ErrorReport.tsx`
   - `app/api/error-reports/route.ts`
   - **Reason**: Will use Question Feedback system instead

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Critical Bug Fixes (COMPLETED)

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Soft Delete Filters (Gap #19 - CRITICAL)
**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/user-attempts/route.ts` (2 locations)
  - Line 30: Added `deletedAt: null` to question lookup
  - Line 200: Added `deletedAt: null` to topic performance lookup

**Impact**:
- Prevents deleted questions from appearing in practice sessions
- Prevents statistics from including deleted questions
- Ensures data integrity across all question queries

**Verification**: All existing question queries already had proper filters:
- ‚úÖ `lib/services/questionService.ts` - All methods filter by `deletedAt: null`
- ‚úÖ `app/api/questions/failed/route.ts` - Has filter
- ‚úÖ `app/api/questions/exam/[examType]/years/route.ts` - Has filter
- ‚úÖ `app/api/topics/route.ts` - Has filter

### 2. ‚úÖ Verified Answer Validation (Gap #20)
**Status**: Already implemented correctly

**Location**: `app/api/user-attempts/route.ts` lines 28-63

**What it does**:
- Server-side validation (doesn't trust client)
- Multiple choice: Validates selected option exists and checks correctness
- Fill-in: Compares answer with correct answer (case-insensitive)
- Rejects attempts with invalid answers

### 3. ‚úÖ Implemented Input Sanitization (Gap #22)
**New File Created**: `lib/sanitizer.ts` (133 lines)

**Functions**:
- `sanitizeQuestionText()` - Strips HTML, preserves LaTeX math ($...$ and $$...$$)
- `sanitizeOptionText()` - Same as question text
- `sanitizeSolutionText()` - Strips HTML, preserves basic formatting (b, i, em, strong, br, p) and LaTeX
- `sanitizeIdentifier()` - Alphanumeric + spaces + hyphens only (for exam names, topics)

**Integration**: `lib/services/questionService.ts`
- ‚úÖ `create()` method - Sanitizes all text inputs before saving
- ‚úÖ `update()` method - Sanitizes all text inputs before updating

**Why Critical**: Prevents rendering issues when importing from:
- PDFs (OCR extraction) - Handles special characters like `<3>` that break HTML
- Web scraping - Strips unwanted HTML tags from scraped content
- Images (OCR) - Handles malformed text extraction

**Dependencies**: Uses existing `isomorphic-dompurify` package

## ‚úÖ Build Verification

**Dev Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors
- ‚úÖ All API routes compile successfully
- ‚úÖ 1426 modules compiled in 8.4s

**API Routes Tested**:
- ‚úÖ GET / - 200 OK
- ‚úÖ GET /api/daily-progress - 200 OK
- ‚úÖ GET /api/achievements - 200 OK
- ‚úÖ GET /api/questions - 200 OK

## üìã Phase 3: Remaining Work (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

### Priority 1: API Enhancements
1. ‚è≥ **Per-Question Statistics API** (Gap #13)
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/questions/[id]/stats`
   - Returns: attempts, accuracy, avg time, difficulty rating
   - Use case: Identify too-hard/too-easy questions

2. ‚è≥ **Bulk Operations API** (Gap #14)
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/questions/bulk-update`
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/questions/bulk-delete`
   - Use case: Manage large question sets efficiently

3. ‚è≥ **Centralized Error Handler** (Gap #8)
   - Refactor all API routes to use `lib/error-handler.ts`
   - Use case: Consistent error responses

4. ‚è≥ **Selective Caching** (Gap #9)
   - Cache questions, topics, achievements (static data)
   - Use existing `lib/cache.ts`
   - Use case: Improve performance for large datasets (1000+ questions)

### Priority 2: Features
1. ‚è≥ **Tutor Dashboard with Resolution Tracking** (Gap #3)
   - Show weak areas (topics < 70% accuracy)
   - Show failed questions
   - Mark topics/questions as "resolved" after teaching
   - Filter resolved items from practice

2. ‚è≥ **Question Feedback System** (Gap #4)
   - "Report Issue" button during practice
   - Report types: Wrong answer key, missing diagram, unclear question
   - Feeds into quality system

3. ‚è≥ **Complete Exam Simulation** (Gap #5)
   - File: `app/practice/amc8/simulation/page.tsx`
   - Countdown timer implementation
   - Auto-submit at time expiration
   - 5-minute warning popup
   - Review screen before final submit
   - Score report matching AMC8 format

4. ‚è≥ **Standardize Session Storage** (Gap #16)
   - Use localStorage for ALL practice sessions
   - Auto-save every answer
   - Preserve state on browser refresh
   - Files to update: All practice pages

5. ‚è≥ **Improve InteractiveDiagram** (Gap #18)
   - Enhance `components/diagrams/InteractiveDiagram.tsx`
   - Add educational interactions

### Priority 3: Document Processor
1. ‚è≥ **Enhance Document Processor** (Gap #7)
   - Current: `lib/document-processor.ts`
   - Add: Import from images (OCR)
   - Add: Import from PDFs (text + OCR)
   - Add: Web scraping functionality
   - Add: Export questions functionality
   - Use: Tesseract.js (already in dependencies)

## üìä Impact Summary

### Code Reduction:
- **Deleted**: ~2,100 lines of unused code
- **Added**: 133 lines (sanitizer) + 50 lines (modifications)
- **Net Reduction**: ~1,900 lines
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Easier maintenance, faster builds

### Bug Fixes:
- **Critical Bug**: Soft delete filters - Prevents data integrity issues
- **Data Validation**: Already properly implemented
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevents rendering issues from imported data

### Performance:
- **Build Time**: Unchanged (~8-10s)
- **Dev Server**: Running smoothly
- **Future Gains**: Caching will improve performance when question count grows

## üîç Design Clarifications (Documented in Code)

1. **Authentication**: Intentionally absent - Single-user application for Ayansh
   - Documented in: `lib/userContext.ts`
   - Documented in: `app/api/sessions/route.ts`

2. **Rate Limiting**: Intentionally removed - Unnecessary for local app

3. **Tutor Dashboard**: Single-user feature for tracking Ayansh's weak areas, NOT multi-user

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test all functionality manually
2. **Short-term**: Implement Priority 1 (API Enhancements)
3. **Medium-term**: Implement Priority 2 (Features)
4. **Long-term**: Implement Priority 3 (Document Processor)
