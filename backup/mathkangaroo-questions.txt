Because the perimeter of the figure on the left consists of four lengths of identical squares, the length of one side of each square equals: 16 --;- 4 --;- 4 = 1 cm. Every rectangle in the other figure is built with two such squares, so the perimeter of one rectangle equals: 2 x 1 + 2 x 2 = 6 cm, and therefore the perimeter of the figure on the right equals: 4 x 6 = 24 cm.

Neither 90 nor 40 is a divisor of 350. We know that Joanna bought at least one pen and at least one pencil for 130 cents. This means 350 - 130 = 220. F\irthcr, she purchased at least two pens and at least two pencils for 260 pencils. Then 350 - 260 = 90, so Joanna bought 3 pens for 90 cents each and 2 pencils for 40 cents each.

After x years later, the sons' ages will be (24 + x) and (18 + x), and the father will be (52 + x) years old. If in x years the sum of the ages of both sons will be equal to the age of the father, we can write an equation:
(24 + x) + (18 + x) = (52 + x)

After solving the above equation, we learn that the ageof the father will be the same as the sum of the ages of both sons 10 years later.

From the definition of supplementary angles, the measure of angle ADC = 150° and the measure of angle ABC = 140°. The sum of inner angles in any quadrangle equals 360°, so the sum of the angles in the figure ABC D is 360°. Thus we can write the equation:
50° + 150° +a+  140° = 360°
and the measure of angle a = 20°.

If Casmir answered wrong x number of questions, the total number of points he earned was: 7(30-x)-12x. Since we know that heearned 77 points we can write the equation: 7(30 - x) - 12x = 77. Then 210 - 7x - 12x = 77 so 19x = 133 thus x = 7.

If p is the price of the ticket and n the number of tickets sold, the total profit of tickets sold before the price was increased was: p x n. For one ticket after the price was changed one person had to pay: p + 0.4p. If m tickets were purchased for the higher price, then the total profit from sold tickets was:
4
m(p + 10P)
We know that the new profit was 26% higher than the profit before the price change so
4	26	14	126

we can write the following equation: m(p +
126	10	90
then m =  -	x -n,	so m = -n.

p) = pn +

100

pn. Thus:	m = l00n,
10	,

This means that the number of tickets sold after
100	14	100
the price increase is 90% of the number of sold tickets for the lower price. Therefore, 10% fewer people went to the theater after the price of the ticket was increased.

LeAbttehseuofmthe  areas of non-shaded regions. The radii of the circles arc 3, 2, 2, and 1. Notice that the area shaded with horizontal lines S is equal to the difference between the area of the big circle with the radius 3 and the area of the sum of non-shaded parts A:
S = 1r x 32 -  A and S = 91r -  A
The  area shaded with vertical lines P is equal to the difference between the sum of the areas of the three smaller circles with radii equal to 2, 2, and 1 and area A. Then P = (2 x 1r22 + 1r x 12) - A and P = 91r - A. The areas of vertically and horizontally shaded parts arc equal.

9871

 Notice that letter I cannot be substituted with numbers 4, 5, 6 because then letter N is supposed to be 7, 8, or 9 and these numbers were already used. The largest possible number for I is 3. Then, X = 6 and N +U + 1 = 7, so N = 2 and U = 4. Then if we substitute letter O with 1 we get:

127

Every third nut out of 2001 equals 667 nuts. There arc then 1334 nuts left, and every fifth nut equals 225 nuts. So, Slawck took 933 nuts. Tomek takes every fifth one from his table, which equals 400 nuts. Out of the 1601 remaining nuts he then takes 533 nuts, for a total of 933 nuts. This means that Tomek and Slawck have the same number of nuts.

Because triangles ACD and AB D have the same areas (because they have the same base AD and the same height AB), the ratio of Arca ABD to Arca ACB is equal to the ratio of Arca ACD to Arca ACB. This is the same as the ratio of 2x (Arca ACB) to Arca ACB, which gives us 2.

The pictures to the right show how we can di- vidc a circle into 5, 7, 9 and 11 parts. 12 is the
only number of parts listed that a circle cannot be divided into.

Let x be the length and y be the width of the net. We can set up two equations and solve for the variables: 2(y+1)+2(x-1) = 28 ==} x+y = 14. Also, (y-l)(x-1) =32. From this we sec that the equations a.re true only for x = 5 and y = 9 or x = 9 and y = 5. Either way, the number of meshes (openings) is 5 x 9 = 45.

a+ b + c + d + e = 72. Also, 72  5a, so a  72/5 and so the smallest number is not greater than 14. Keep in mind that a  b  c  d  e. To find the smallest result of 72 - a, a needs to be the greatest possible. If you think of a= 14 and b = c = 14 and d = e = 15, then Pa.wcl's final answer is 72 - 14 = 58. If number a is smaller than 14 then Pa.wcl's final answer will be greater than 58.

Since the die in the middle has sides with the number of dots from 1 to 6, there is one of each number hidden from among all the sides of the six dice on the outside. So, the sum on the dots on the outside dice is 6(1+2+3+4+5+6)-1(1+2+3+4+5+6) = 5(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 5 X 21 = 105.

The smallest number should have the least number of digits and the first digits should
be the smallest. So, we probably want the digit 9 to appear beyond the first digit. Since 2001 = 222 x 9 + 3, the number is 399 ... 99, where the digit 9 repeats 222 times.

Note that 3 and 5 share an edge, of which one corner contains the side with 2 and the other with 6. Then 3, 5, 6 is clearly the largest product, giving 90.



Notice that 999 = n x a+ 3 and a is a natural number. Because 2001 = 2 x 999 + 3, 2001 = 2(n x a+ 3) + 3 = n x 2a + 9. n is a 2-digit number, so 9 < n. Sinc8 ,n x 2a
is a natural number because both n and a arc natural numbers, we can assume that 9 is the remainder when dividing 2001 by n.

Notice that 1664 = 27  13. Since 13 is not divisible by 2, and 26 (if one of the children were grown-up) cannot be expressed as a power of 2, we sec that the youngest child is less than 13 and the oldest more than 13. 13 then must be the age of a middle child. 27 will account for the ages of the other children, the oldest must be more than 13 and
so is 16 = 21, and the youngest is half of that, or 8 = 23. This accounts for all the powers of 2. So, there arc 3 children in the family.

Each hexagon is connected to a pentagon and each pentagon is connected only with hexagons. The number of all the borders between a pentagon and a hexagon is then 12 x 5 = 60. However, each hexagon is connected with three pentagons. This means that each hexagon was counted three times as bordering a hexagon. So, the number of all the hexagons is (12 x 5) -;- 3 = 20.

Let x be the number of big boxes that arc not empty and y the number of medium boxes that arc not empty.

We know that 0 < x	11 and 0 < y	8x. For the number of all boxes, we can solve: 11 + 8x + 8y = 11 + 8(x + y) = 11 + 8 x 13 = 115.

Since AD = DB, CD has to be the bisector of the angle AC B. Since AD = DC 1 the measures of angles CAD and AC D arc equal, and since DB = DC, the measures of angles DCB and DEC arc equal. Because the sum of the measures of angles CAB,
ABC, ACD, and DCB hasto be equal to 180°, the measure of each one of these angles is 45°, which means that the sum of the measures of angles ACD and DCB, which is the measure of angle AC B, is equal to 90°.

Remember that the interior angles of any polygon add up to (n - 2) x 180°, where n
indicates the number of sides in the polygon. So, for a hexagon the sum of the measures of the interior angles is (6 - 2) x 180° = 720°. All six angles of the hexagon cannot be right angles because 6 x 90° = 540°, which is less than 720°, so the greatest number of inner right angles that hexagon can have is 5. This works because 720° - 5 x 90° = 720° - 450° = 270°, which is less than 360°and so can be the measure of one of the angles.

The sum of two odd numbers is an even number, and the sum of an even and an odd number is an odd number. Since 2003 is the odd number, it has to be represented as the sum of an odd and an even number. The only even number which is also prime is 2, so the sum would be 2 + 2001 = 2003, but 2001 is not a prime number.

17. (E) 75%
From the information that the freight made up 80% of the weight of the loaded truck we know that the weight of the empty truck was 20% of the loaded truck. Since 2000 kg is the 20%, 100% is equal to 10,000 kg (the weight of the loaded truck), and the weight of the load was 10,000-2000 = 8000 kg. Because 1 of the freight was unloaded,
1 x 10,000 = 2, 500 kg was unloaded, which is equal to 25% of the weight of the loaded truck, so the freight made up 75% of the loaded truck after the first stop.

Let B indicate the capacity of one bottle, G the capacity of one glass, and P the capacity of one pitcher. According to the information given we can write: B + G = P and B = G + M. So: G + M + G = P, and thus 2G+ M = P. We also can write that

Let a and b indicate the length of the sides of the rectangular base. The-perimeter of the base is equal to 2(a+ b) = 18 cm, which means that a+b = 9 cm, sohe possible pairs of the lengths of the sides of the base arc: 2 cm and 7 cm, 3 cm and 6 cm, and 4 cm and 5 cm. Notice that to create a rectangular prism, the number of all blocks used to build the prism divided by the number of blocks in the base has to be a whole number. Only the base with a length of the sides equal to 2 cm and 7 cm fulfills this condition. Since the number of blocks in the base is equal to 2 x 7 = 14, thus the number of layers of the prism is 427 14 = 3, so the height of the prism is equal to 3 cm.

We can now set up a proportion: 1 kg fresh mushrooms makes 0.1 kg mushroom meat, and x kg
fresh mushrooms makes 0.89kg mushroom meat. Then -1 = --X.  Solving, we get
0.1	0.89
x = 8.9kg.

Let AABCD be the area of rectangle ABCD and AsPQR be the area of rhombus SPQR. Points P, Q, R, and S arc the midpoints of consecutive sides of the rectangle, and if you try to slide the triangle S RD along the diagonal DB so points S and R cover points P and Q, and triangle APS along the diagonal AC so points S and P cover points Rand Q you will notice that triangles APS, PBQ, QCR, and SRD cover half of the area of rectangle ABCD. This means that the area of rhombus SPQR is half

of the area of rectangle ABCD (AABCD) and  we can wntc:  AsPQR = 2AABCD· By
sliding triangle RQT along segment RS we can also notice that the sum of the area of triangle RQT and the area of triangle PTS is equal to half of the area of rhombus
PQRS.  This means that the area of triangle PQT is half of the area of rhombus

Remember that to create any triangle the sum of the lengths of any two of its sides has to be greater than the length of the third side. Adding 1 to any of the other numbers from the set docs not produce sets that work. This means that we can combine only the numbers 2, 3, 2001, 2002, 2003. We can do this in 6 different ways: (2,2001,2002),
(2, 2002,2003), (3,2001,2002), (3,2002,2003), (3,2001,2003), and (2001,2002,2003).

If the square with a side of 11 and the square with a side of 7 were shaded completely, the combined area of the shaded region would be 11 x 11 + 7 x 7 = 170. If the square with a side of 9 and the square of a side of 5 were all black, the combined area of the black region would be 9 x 9 + 5 x 5 = 106. Since the white region is the area of
overlap of the two regions, we can still simply subtract the areas from each other. The difference between combined area of the shaded regions and the combined area of the black regions is 170 - 106 = 64.

The greatest number of zeros is obtained by multiplying 2 and 5, and the more such pairs in the multiplication, the more zeros at the end of the product. Try to write every number listed in the answers as a multiplication of the power of theirs factors:

3125 = 55

2500 = 22 X 51 '

10000 = 21 X 51

And the number we arc multiplying by: 768 = 28 x 3. Now, we sec that thenumber 768
has no factors of 5, but 8 factors of 2, and the number 3125 has the largest number of factors of 5. So, by multiplying them we will get the number with the largest number of zeros at the end.

n = 3 x 5 x a2.  This means that the smallest factor of n is 2 or 3.  If a = 2 then

Start by working with some numbers from 10 to 19, some from 20 to 29, and some from 30 to 39.
For example: deleting O from the number 10 leaves 1 and 1 x 10 = 10.
Deleting 5 from the number 15 leaves 1 and 1 x 15 = 15.
It is easy to sec that for the first ten 2-digit numbers the greatest quotient is 19, because 1 x 19 = 19. For 20 - 29, the greatest such quotient is 14, because multiplying 2 by 15 gives 30, so the first digit is different than 2. For 30 - 39, the gTcatcst quotient is 13, and for the next ten numbers it's 12. For numbers from 50 to 100 such a quotient is 11, and for numbers with more than 2 digits, the quotient is just 10. This means that the greatest possible value of n equals 19.

1980 = 1 r 23). Every divisor of 1980 greater than 23 also divides 2003 with a remainder
equal to 23. Factoring 1980 we get 22 x 32 x 5 x 11, which means the factors arc 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 30, 33, 36, 44, 45, 55, 60, 66, 90, 99, 110, 132,
165, 180, 198, 220, 330, 396, 495, 660, 990, 1980. So, including 1980, there arc 22 such numbers.

Each of the angles of the triangle has a measure of 60°, and each of the angles of the pentagon has a measure of 108°. We can find the missing angles of the small triangle on the bottom by first noting that one of its angles is supplementary to one of the angles of the pentagon (sec the picture), and thus measures 180° - 108° = 72°. The
other angles measures 180° - 60° - 72° = 48°. Again using supplementary angles, we find that x = 180° - 48° = 132°.

So we sec that noother attempts will result in a two-digit number. Thus, the numbers arc 27, 45, 63, 75, 99, and there arc 5 of them.

22. (E) The sum of the number on each diagonal equals 20.
A) Not true, because the greatest sum of four different natural odd numbers less than 20 is 19 + 17 + 15 + 13 = 64.
B) Not true, because the smallest possible sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16.
C) Not true, because 2005 is only divisible by 1, 5, 401 and 2005.
D) The only way to get 21 using two odd natural numbers less than 20 is by 3 x 7, so this can occur on only one diagonal if each number is different.
E) Can be true. Consider 17 in the top left square, 1 in the top right, 19 in the bottom left, and 3 in the bottom right.

To get the greatest possible number at the end, start the problem with labeling A as 3, Gas 4, K as 5, N as 6, 0 as 7, R as 8, and U as 9, because this m;cs the greatest digits. Rearranging the digits to corrcspondc; to KANGOUROU gives D) as the answer.

The only digits that arc also cubes arc 1, 4, and 9. 1 will not work as the first digit, because then all the digits would be 1. However, the numbers 4 21, 463, 931, and 962 have the desired property.

25. (E) 720°
Notice that allthe non-marked angles of the triangles along with the opposite congruent angle of each at point O add up to a whole circle, or 360°. This means that the 5 non-
marked angles of the triangles add up to 180°. Since there arc 5 triangles total, the total sum of the angles of the triangles is 5 x 180° = 900°. Subtracting the non-shaded angles from the sum we get 900° - 180° = 720°.



After the 1st replacement the mixture has 48 liters of juice and 16 liters of'watcr. The proportion of juice to water is now 3 : 1. In the 2nd step, the 16 liters that were removed contained 12 liters of juice and 4 liters of water. There were now 36 liters
of juice and 12 liters of water, and after the replacement was completed by adding 16 liters of water there were 36 liters of juice and 28 liters of water, so the proportion is 9 : 7. In the 3rd step, the 16 liters removed contained 9 liters juice and 7 liters water. This left 27 liters of juice and 21 liters of water, which became 37 liters of water once the 16 liters were added to it.

Since the smaller number will be more than 11, which means that the two numbers will differ by more than 30, the tens digit ha..c; to at lca..c;t 3 times the ones digit. If the ones digit is 1, then 31 docs not work (because 3 x 13 = 39), 41 docs not work (3 x 14 = 42), but 51 works (3 x 15 = 45), and so 61, 71, 81 and 91 will also work (notice that the difference between the original number and the product of 3 and the reversed number was dccrca..c;ing). If the ones digit is 2, 62 docs not work (3 x 26 = 78), 72 docs not (3 x 27 = 81), 82 docs not (3 x 28 = 84, and only 92 docs (3 x 29 = 87).
If the ones digit was 3, the number would have to be 93, but 3 x 39 = 117. So, there arc only 6 such numbers: 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, and 92.

After two hours, the particle will have moved a distance equal to 120 units. Notice that by the time the particle reaches a point on the x-axis with an even x coordinate,
it has been through every point with coordinates which arc natural numbers within a square area (outlined in bold in the picture), which can be expressed as (x + 1)2. The number of units traveled is one less than the number of points, so it is (x + 1)2 - 1. If we now notice that 120 can be written as 121 - 1 = 112 - 1 = (10 + 1)2 - 1, we have the solution: the particle will be at (10, 0). Had the number of units traveled been
different, we might have needed to add or subtract the additional steps at this point.

There arc 5 points marked in the picture. Because the question focuses on the sums of various combinations not being divisible by 3, we will focus on the reminders from division by 3. We consider this set: {0,1,2}, which represent the various integers by listing the remainders. Suppose we assume that none of the numbers have a remainder of 0. Then, because numbers 1 and 2 cannot be next to each other (because the sum would be divisible by 3), all numbers on the circle would be equal to 1 or all be equal to 2. However, this contradicts the conditions in our problem here, because the sum of three identical numbers (or three numbers with the same remainder when divided by 3) is divisible by 3. Thcrcforc,at least one of the numbers is 0. Let's say a= 0. Then b =/=- 0 and e =/=- 0 and b = e. If c =/=- 0 and d =/=- 0 then b = c = d = e, which contradicts our problem, because again three numbers would give a sum that is divisible by 3. Then, either c = 0 or d = 0. Because c and d arc neighboring numbers, they can't be both O at the	same time. Now we can conclude that exactly two out of five numbers on the circle arc divisible by 3.

If we choose 55 and 10 to be the angle measures of the acute triangle, then the third angle would measure 115 degrees, which is impossible. The only other possibility arc the angles with measure 80 and 55. Choosing these we sec that the third angle measures 45 degrees and since all three angles arc acute, the answer is 45 dcgTccs.

If the first person in line is speaking the truth, then the last person in line is a liar. Then what # 25 said must be a lie, i.e. the person in front of the last person is a knight. Consequently #23 is a liar, since #24, a knight, spoke the truth. Continuing thus we sec that # 1 is a liar, a contradiction. Therefore, the first person in line is a liar. Therefore, the person behind the first person is a knight, and spoke the truth. But #3 in saying that the person in front of #3 is a liar, told a lie, and is therefore a liar.

If n is even then 2 is the smallest divisor, so the largest divisor must be 90 and n = 180. If n is odd and k is the smallest divisor of n, then k is odd and so is 45k. Choosing k = 3, the greatest divisor is 135 and so n = 405. If k > 3 then the largest divisor is divisible by 5 and so is n, and therefore k	7 will not work. If k = 5, the largest divisor is 225, which is divisible by 3 and thus so is n, but k = 5 is supposed to be the smallest divisor. There arc only the two possibilities we have listed.

If we want to minimize the side length of the large square we must minimize the side length of the 2009 smaller squares and all must be identical. Let each smaller square have side length 1.

These circles intersect at two points, which in the rectangle PQRS arc very close to either point Q or point S. In the second case we do not have a convex polygon and angle Q exceeds 180 degrees. Therefore, only angles P,R,S arc necessarily less that 180degrees.

Let K be the point of intersection of the bisector of angle A and the side BC. Create an isosceles triangle by having L be the point on BC such that [ELI = [ABI. Then, since b.ABC is isosceles we have LEAL= 80°= LELA. From the information given it follows that also LAKL = 80° Therefore, b.AKL is isosceles, and [AKI= 2 = IALI. We now know the measures of all remaining angles and we observe that b.ALC is isosceles. Therefore, 2 = [ALI = ILCI. But [BCI - IABI = IBCI - IBLI = ILCI = 2.

Four choices of the point F arise when DE is not the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
If DE is the hypotenuse, then by a theorem of Thales, the point F will lie on a circle with diameter equal to 2. The equation of this circle, in Cartesian coordinates, is x2 + y2 = 4 and we also require that the area of our triangle be equal to 1, whence it follows that xy = 2. Substituting for y, we obtain the equation x1 - 4x2 +4 = 0, which has exactly two distinct real-number solutions. These solutions correspond to the two distinct x-coordinatcs that give the final two possibilities for the point F.

Similarly, looking from top to bottom, there arc two cuts that go across the entire square. These lengths arc also counted twice. In addition to the edges of the square, there arc 10 lengths, each equal to the side length of the square, that together make up the total perimeter of 120 cm. Thus, the square has an edge length equal to 12 cm and an area of 144 square centimeters.

The 8-point shots have to come in multiples of three, or in groups of 24 points, so that together with a 5-point shot the score will be w 2-digit number ending in 9. Bob makes as many 10-point as 8-point shots, so assuming he hit the 8-point target 3 times, he will have earned 54 points with 6 shots. He needs some 5-point shots to get the score up to 99 points, while still missing 25% of the time. With 9 shots worth 5-points each he will have 99 points in 15 hits of the target, so assuming he missed a quarter of the time, Bob took 20 shots in all.

Let the points A, J, K represent the respective location of Adam, John, and Karl, and plot these points on a number line. Using absolute value, we can express each of their statements in the following way.
1. Adam: IA - JI > 2IA - Kl
2. John: IJ - Kl > 2IJ- Al
3. Karl: IK - JI > 21K - Al
Since at least two statements arc true, we check the consistency of the above equations two at a time. Suppose first that both Adam and John arc telling the truth. Adding inequalities (a) and (b), we have
IA - JI+ IJ - Kl > 2IA - Kl+	2IJ - Al
> 2IJ-KI,
bythetriangle inequality, whence IA - JI > IJ - Kl. But, this together with John's statement yields IA- JI > 2IA- JI,which is a contradiction. Next, suppose that both John and Karl arc telling the truth. Adding inequalities (b) and (c), we have
IJ - Kl+	IK - JI > 2IJ - Al+ 21K - Al
> 2IJ-KI,
bythetriangle inequality, whence we arrive at the contradiction IJ - Kl > IJ - Kl.
finally, suppose that both Adam and Karl arc telling the truth. Adding inequalities
(a) and (c), we have
IA - JI+ IK - JI > 2IA - Kl+	21K - Al
=4IA-KI,
which docs not lead to a contradiction. We conclude that only John's statement is false.

Notice that the la..c;;t digit of the sum of the 5-digit and the 4-digit numbers is 3.

In order to receive 3 as the la..c;;t digit of the sum of the two numbers you must add 2 with 1, 1 with 2, 9 with 4 or 4 with 9. Working backwards with the addition of the 5-digit number and the 4-digit number, we find that only if the last digit in the first number is 1 and the la..c;;t digit in the second number is 2 we get the sum equal to 52,713. The original 5-digit number is 47,921 and the 4-digit

The area of the corner triangle is the difference between the area of the square and the area of the pentagon. Therefore, the triangle has the area 1 since two consecutive integers differ by 1. It is geometrically obvious that the area of the corner triangle is

1 of a quarter of the original square. So the area of the triangle is
2
area of the square. Thus, A = 1 and A = 8.

The vertices arc labeled A through H.  In 6ABE the side BE can't be blue and in 6BF E the same side can't be green, so BE is red. Therefore, the side BF is blue. Similarly, the side DG (look at 6C DG and 6D HE) is red, so the side CG is green. For the same reason the common side, CF, of 6BCF and6CGF must be red. Consequently, BC is green.

We know that 25% of the weight is taken up by the two lightest kangaroos and 60% of the weight is taken up by the heaviest three kangaroos. The rest of the weight is 15% which is less than the weight of the two lightest kangaroos. Therefore, there can only be one extra kangaroo because if there were two or more, they would weigh less
than the two lightest. So the total number of kangaroos is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. One possible weight distribution is 12%, 13%, 15%, 19%, 20%, and 21% of the total weight.

Let c1 ::::; c--2 ::::; c3 ::::; c1 ::::; c5 be integers written on the 5 cards. Then c1 + c2 = 57 and c1 + c5 = 83. 57 and 83 arc odd, so c1 -I= c2 and c3 -I= c1. Thus c1 < c2 ::::; c3 ::::; c1 < c5. If c2 < c3, then c1 < c2 < c3 ::::; c1 < c5 and c1 + c2 < c1 + c3 < c2 + c5, so we would have more than three sums. Therefore c2 = c3.
If c3 < c1, then c1 < c2 ::::; c3 < c1 < c5 and c1 + c2 < c1 + c1 < c2 + c1 < c2 + c5, so we would have more than three sums. Therefore c3 = c1 and c1 < c2 = c3 = c1 < c5.
Consequently, 2c2 = c2 + c3 = 70, c1  = c3 = c2 = 35, c1 = 57 - 35 = 22, and
C5 = 83 - 35 = 48.

Since 2015 = 671 · 3 + 2, we know that the last time the integer quotient is 2 happens
for 672. 2015 = 2 x 672 + 671, so 671 is the highest remainder since 2015 = q x d + r,

Suppose 1 is green. Either there is no other green number or there is a green number greater than 1.
(Case 1): If there is no other green, then the pattern is GRRRRRRRR. ..
(Case 2): If there is another gTccn number, then look at the first such number. Call it
g. Then, since g and 1 arc green, we know that only numbers greater than 1 and less than g arc red. Consider the cases when g = 2, g = 3, and g 2:: 4.
(i) g = 2, so the pattern is (green only) GGGGGGGGGGGGGG...
(ii) g = 3, so only 2 is red. The pattern is GRGGGGGGGGGGGG...
(iii) g 2:: 4, so 2 and  3 arc  red, so 3+2,3+ (2 x x2),3+ (2 x 3), ... ,3+ (2 x g) ... , arc all red. But 3 + (2 x g) 2:: g, so it must be gTccn. This contradiction shows that there arc no more patterns starting with green 1. The same argument works when 1 is red. Therefore, there arc 6 patterns of coloring positive integers. Note that the first green number cannot be 3 or greater, because then two smaller numbers whose sum is the first green number would also have to be gTccn, creating a contradiction.



Let A, B, C, D, Ebe the five points from left to right. If one of the primitive segments, AB, BC, CD, or DE, has length greater than 9, then 22 = AE = AB+BC+CD+DE > 9 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 22, so each primitive segment has the length less than or equal to 9. If 9 is not among primitive segments, then 22 = AE = 2 + 5 + 6 + 8 = 21. This
contradiction indicates that 9 must be the length of a primitive segment but 8 cannot, since 9 +8 + 2 + 5 = 24 > 22. Therefore, the lengths of primitive segments arc 2, 5, 6,
9. The segments 2 and 5 can't be adjacent since 2 + 5 = 7 is not on the list. 9 alone
can't be between 2 and 5 since 11 = 2 + 9 and 14 = 5 + 9 can't be both on the list; only one of them could be k. 6 alone can't be between 2 and 5 since 11 = 5 + 6 and 13 = 5 + 6 + 2 can't be both on the list; only one of them could he k. Thus, both segments, 6 and 9, must he between 2 and 5, so 2 and 5 arc at the endpoints of AE and 6 and 9 arc in the middle. We may assume (changing the direction from left to right
if needed) AB= 2 and DE= 5. Then BC can't be 9 since 2, 9, 6, 5 would produce two segments with the same length 11. Therefore, (assuming AB = 2) there is only one option for the primitive segments. AB= 2, BC= 6, CD= 9, and DE= 5. In the figure given below, we sec the points with distances labeled.

No multiplication factor can be 1 (no repetition of digits) and one factor·must be 2 to keep the product below 10. The other factor is either 3 or 4 for the same tcason.
If the  product is 2 x 3 = 6, then the difference can be either 5 or 1 since 6 -  2 = 4,
6 - 4 = 2, and 6 - 3 = 3 arc already excluded. At this stage, the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 have been used. For the next subtraction, we can only use digits 4, 7, 8, and 9. However, each of the possible subtractions, 9 - 4 = 5, 9 - 7 = 2, 9 - 8 = 1, 8 - 4 = 4,
8 - 7 = 1, and 7 - 4 = 3, either contains a duplication of digits or uses 1, 2, 3, or 5. None of the subtractions is valid. Therefore, the product must be 8, and the factors
arc 2 and 4 (in any order).
The subtraction under the multiplication can be 8 - 1 = 7, 8 - 7 = 1, 8 - 3 = 5, or 8 - 5 = 3. So far, we have used the digits 2, 4, 8, and two odd digits. Only one even digit, namely 6, is left for further operations. If "?" is not 6, then the addition involves two odd digits, and the sum is even. Thus, "?" must be 6. However, if "?" is 6, then the second subtraction in the diagram involves odd numbers, and the result, "?", is even. This contradiction shows that "?" must indeed be 6.

Among the six possible differences (14 - 12, 14 - 8, 14 - 3, 12 - 8, 12 - 3, and 8 - 3),
only 8 - 3 = 5 is a multiple of 5. Hence, Rita is 8 and Ema is 3. (Z + 3) and (Z + 8) arc multiples of 5, so Z = 12. Therefore, Iva is 14.

3-522 is equal to the sum of all five numbers minus the sum of the numbers in the first three boxes, which is also equal to the sum of the numbers in the last two boxes.
Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the last two boxes is 13. We know that one of the numbers is 4, so the number in the second gray box is 13 - 4 = 9.
Similarly, 10 = 35 - 25 is equal to the sum of the numbers in the first two boxes. We know that 3 is oneof these numbers, so 10 - 3 = 7 is the number in the first gray box. The product of the numbers in the gray boxes is 7 x 9 = 63, which indeed satisfies all the requirements. We can have 3, 7, 12, 9, and 4.

The bus Bk will reach the center in (60 - 3k) minutes, and the car will reach the center in 35 minutes. Therefore, the car will pass the kth bus if (60 - 3k) > 35. We can calculate the times for the buses B1, B2, B3, ...  , B9 to reach the center:

B1 : 60 - 3(1) = 57 minutes
B2 : 60 - 3(2) = 54 minutes

B1 : 60 - 3(4) = 48 minutes

B1 : 60 - 3(7) = 39 minutes

Observing the pattern, we notice that after the first two digits (2, 3), the sequence 6, 8, 8, 4, 2,8 repeats indefinitely.
We can observe that every digit in the (7 + a multiple of 6)th position is equal to 2.
For example, the 7th digit, 13th digit, 19th digit, 25th digit, and so on, arc all equal to 2.
To find the digit in the 2017th position, we can write 2017 as 7 + 6 x 335. Therefore,
the 2017th digit will be the same as the 7th digit, which is 2. Hence, the 2017th digit in the sequence is 2.

Thetoptwo rows cannot have more than 2 odd numbers. Similarly, the top three rows cannot have more than 4 odd numbers. Indeed, if the third row consists of only Os (odd numbers), then all numbers above arc Es (even numbers), so there arc only 3 odd numbers. If the third row contains only 2 (or less) Os, then the total of Os is less than or equal to (2 + 2) = 4.
The top four rows cannot have more than 7 odd numbers. This is true when the fourth row has at most 3 Os since 3 + 4 = 7. When the fourth row consists of four Os, then the top four rows have only 4 Os. If the whole pyramid of five rows has only 3 Os in the bottom row, then the numbers of Os in this pyramid docs not exceed 3 + 7 = 10 Os.
If the bottom row consists of 5 Os, then the whole pyramid has exactly 5 Os. Thus, we have to analyze only pyramids with 4 Os in the bottom row. By placing O OE 0 0 in the bottom row, we can have 10 O's. Note that OE O OE in the bottom row also works.

Also, dogs, cows and kangaroos (i.e. not cats) total 16, so there arc 13 cows and kangaroos. Solving, we find that there arc 7 kangaroos, 8 cats and 6 cows.

Suppose there arc n teams. Each player plays with 3 players from each of the other
n - 1 teams, so they play 3(n - 1) games. This means that the total number of games is 1
2 x 3n x 3(n - 1) (notice we divide by 2 because each game is counted twice). This
sets up the inequality ;n(n - 1) :S: 250.
The function n( n - 1) is increasing, so we can find a suitable value for n by trying a few values. For example, if we plug in n = 8, we would get 252 games, which is too large. However, the next lowest value, n = 7, gives 189 games, which is less than 250.

Let the number of passengers in the first five carriages be P, Q, R, S,T, and let X be the number of passengers in the sixth carriage. We arc given that P+Q+R+S +T = 199 = Q + R + S +T + X. It follows that P = X. In a similar way, we sec that the number of passengers in the carriages is a periodic sequence, as shown in the figure. The two middle carriages have S and T passengers, respectively, so the problem asks for S + T. As all passengers amount to 700, we conclude that the last three carriages satisfy P+Q+R = 700-3x199 = 103. So, S+T = (P+Q+R+S+T)-(P+Q+R) = 199 - 103 - 96.

Suppose that Eric had gotten every single question on the quiz correct, without leaving any questions blank. Then, he would have gotten 7 · 20 = 140 points. However, he actually got 100 points. This means that he lost 40 points by leaving some questions
blank and getting some questions wrong.
Let b be the number of questions Eric left blank, and let w be the number of questions Eric got wrong. We know that band w arc nonnegative integers. Now, note that for every question that Eric left blank, he got 7 fewer points than he would have gotten if he had answered it correctly. And for every question he got wrong, he got 11 fewer points than he would have gotten if he had gotten it correct. Therefore, 7b+ llw = 40.
Since b 2:: 0, llw:::;7b+llw = 40, or llw:::;40.
Since w is an integer, w:::; 3 (inother words, if w 2:: 4, then llw > 40).

Let p be the number of pears in the box. Clearly, there arc 2p apples in the box. Let a be the number of apples that Lily took. Since all of the apples were taken by either Christy or Lily, this means that Christy took 2p - a apples. Since Christy got twice the number of fruits as Lily and the only remaining fruits arc pears, we can calculate the number of pears that Christy took. Let this number be x. By similar reasoning to the apples, we know that Lily took p - x pears.
(2p -  a) apples+ x pears= 2  (a apples+ (p -  x) pears)
2p - a - x = 2p + 2a - 2x
-a-x = 2a-2x

Since Lily took a apples and Christy took x pears, we know that Christy took a..<; many pears as Lily got apples.

Let the face corresponding to the left-most diagram be face 1, the one corresponding to the middle diagram be face 2, and the one corresponding to the right-most diagram face 3. In a tetrahedron, any set of three faces must be adjacent to the fourth face, and each pair of faces within the set must be adjacent. Indeed, we can tell that face 2 is on the left of face 1, since face l's left edge reads DCBD from the top down, and face 2's right edge also reads DCBD. Similarly, face 3 must be on the right of face 1. Now that we know how the faces align, we can count the number of D's. The top-most D is common to face 1, 2, and 3. Then, there is a D on the right edge of face 1 (aka the left edge of face 3). finally, there is a D on the left edge of face 1 (aka the right edge of face 3). Since there arc only 3 D's on the faces shown and there arc 4 cannon balls with each label, we know that the hidden cannon ball must be labeled -

Let the number of red counters be r, and define g, b, and y similarly for green, blue, and yellow, respectively. Since the box contains only green, red, blue, and yellow, the maximum possible number of counters we could pick before we get a red counter is

counters arc left and we arc guaranteed a red one on our next pick. In other words, g +b+ y S 25- 1. Similarly, r +b+ y S 27- 1, r +g + y S 22- 1, and r + g + b S 17 - 1. Adding these together, r + g + b + y S 29. Before we can conclude, we know that 29 is an upper bound for r + g + b + y, but we must first verify that it is possible to achieve this theoretical maximum. Turning all of the S signs into = signs, we can solve the
resulting system of equations to get r = 5, g = 3, b = 8, and y = 13 as a solution that satisfies all of the inequalities. Therefore, I29Iis the largest number of counters that

There arc 12 pentagons in the ball: 1 on top, 1 on the bottom, and 2 horizontal rings of 5 in the middle. Each pentagon has 5 sides, and is only adjacent to hexagons, so there arc a total of 12 · 5 = 60 hexagons adjacent to pentagons. However, each hexagon is adjacent to exactly 3 pentagons, which means that each hexagon was counted 3 times (1 time for each pentagon that it borders). When we account for this ovcrcounting, the total number of hexagons is 60-;-3 = 20.
As an aside, another interesting way to solve this problem is to consider the icosa- hedron and dodecahedron. The hexagons form the 20 faces of an icosahedron, with the pentagons being the 12 vertices. Or, the pentagons could form the 12 faces of a dodecahedron, with the hexagons forming the 20 vertices.

Divide the numbers from 1 to 2021 into three groups based on their remainders when divided by three. There arc only 3 possible remainders when a number is divided by 3: 0, 1, or 2. Call these groups residue classes. Let the residue class r.. be the residue class whose remainder when divided by 3 is n. In other words, the three residue classes
arc r 0 r, 1, an dr 2 . Now, we will show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between residue classes and the color of the kangaroos.
Since Kangaroos 1, 2, and 3 must have different colors, and Kangaroos 2, 3, and 4 must have different colors, neither Kangaroo 1 nor Kangaroo 4 can be the color of either Kangaroo 2 or Kangaroo 3. But since there arc only 3 colors (red, gray, and blue), this means that Kangaroo 1 must be the same color as Kangaroo 4. This analysis can be repeated to show that Kangaroos 2 and 5 must be the same color, as must 3 and 6, 4 and 7, 5 and 8, 6 and 9, etc. Since the colors repeat every 3 ka,ngaroos and residue classes also repeat every 3 numbers, each residue class has a unique color.
Since the remainders of 2, 20, and 2021 when divided by 3 arc all 2, they all belong to
r2. Bruce's guesses for the color of r2 arc gray, blue, and gray (from Kangaroo 2, 20,

number of cubes that the termite passes through is 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = IN].

There arc 3 possibilities for a pair: it can either be knight-knight, knight-knave, or knave-knave. In a knight-knight pair, each knight would correctly describe the other as a knight. In a knight-knave pair, the knight would correctly describe the knave as a knave, and the knave would incorrectly describe the knight as a knave. And in a knave- knave pair, each knave would incorrectly describe the other as a knight. Therefore, every two people who were described as knaves corresponds to one knight-knave pair. Since 20 people were called knaves, there must have been exactly 10 knight-knave pairs. Since the wizard divided 2020 out of the 2021 people into pairs, there must be 1 person left out. We can now determine whether that person was a knight or a knave. Suppose that the number of knights that were included is k. Each knight-knight pair adds 2 to k, each knight-knave pair adds 1 to k, and each knave-knave pair adds 0 to k. This means that if the number of knight-knave pairs is even, then k must be even, since knight-knight pairs and knave-knave pairs both add an even number to k. And indeed, we have just shown that there were 10 knight-knave pairs, which means that k must be even. And since there arc 21 knights and k must be even, the person who was left out must have been a knight.
We now know that out of the 2020 people who were paired, 2000 were knaves and 20 were knights. Additionally, there were 10 knight-knave pairs. This leaves 1990 knaves who must have been paired with each other, making the number of knave-knave pairs 1990 2 = I995I.

The key observation is that a team cannot play in two matches at the same time. Using this observation, we can fill in the remaining matches one by one. A-D cannot take place in rounds 1, 2, 3, or 5, since either A or D is playing in those rounds. So, it must take place in round 4. Now, since A is playing in rounds 1, 3, 4, and 5, A-F must take place in round 2. Since C or Eis playing in rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, C-E must

take place in round 1. Similarly, D-E must take place in round 5. Now? B-D must take place in round 3. B-C must take place in round 4. C-F must take place in round 3.
And finally, D-F must take place in round DJ. We can optionally fill in B-E in round
2 and B-F in round 5 to complete the schedule and prove that it works.

Label the vertices A, B, C, and D, starting at the upper left-hand corner and going clockwise. Additionally, let [6XY Z] denote the area of 6XY Z for any three vertices X, Y, and Z.
Notice that by the 1 base · height formula for the area of a triangle, [6DKT]  =
2
2[6TKC], [6DKW] = 2[6WKA], [6BKS] = 2[6SKC], and [6BKP] = 2[6PKA].
Therefore, [6DKT] + [6DKW] + [6BKS] + [6BKP] = 2- ([6TKC] + [6WKA] +
[6SKC] + [6PKA]).
Equivalently, ([6DKT] + [6DKW]) + ([6BKS] + [6BKP]) = 2 · (([6TKC] +
[6SKC]) + ([6WKA] + [6PKA])) Or, 18 + 10 = 2 · ([6TKC] + [6SKC] + 8).
Solving, we get that the area of the shaded quadrilateral is [6TKC] + [6SKC] =
(28	2) - 8 = 6.

Observe that the sum of the two numbers in any two opposite edges is the same. For example the edges with end points a, band c, d,respectively, have sum (a+b)+(c+d) = a+ b+ c + d which is the same as the sum (a+ d) + (b + c) of two other opposite edges. So in our case the number at the edge with the question mark is 8 + 13 - 9 = 12.

Let D1, D2, D3, D1, and D5 be the various discs. D1 has the smallest radius and D5 the largest. If Anna's tower has D5 at the bottom, there arc 6 options for making a tower:
D5, D1, D3; D5, D1, D2; D5, D1, D1;
Ds, D:i, D2; Ds, D:i, D1;
and Ds, D2, D1.
If the tower has D1 at the bottom, there arc 3 possible towers: D1, D3, D2; D1, D3,
D1;
and D1, D2, D1.
finally, she can make a tower with D3 on the bottom, with the only possibility being
D3, D2, D1.
In total, this gives 6 + 3 + 1 = 10 towers.



Tshueofmall the whole numbers from 1 to 8 is
1 +2+3+4+5+6+7 +8 = (1+8)+ (2+7) + (3+6) + (4+5) = 4 x 9 = 39. Since the
sum of the numbers in each row must be equal, each row must add up to half of 36,
which is 18. Similarly, each column must sum to 9 since we have four columns. filling
6 4 1 7
out the grid in this way gives 3	5	8 2


Notice that the hundreds digit is different in the first and second consecutive whole numbers. This means that in the first number, the tens and ones digits must be 99, and in the second number they must be 00. Hence?= 9 andc:::> = 0. But comparing
the second and third numbers we must have that ?= 1. The numbers written arc thus
199, 200, 201, so we conclude that c:::> = 2. Therefore the next number 202 = Q6Q.

Let r be the common radius of the semicircles. Consider the line segment that begins at the left side of the left-most semicircle and extends to the right side of the right-most semicircle. Looking along the top semicircles, the length of this segment is 2r +12+
2r + 12+ 2r = 6r + 24. Looking along the bottom semicircles, this segment has length 22 + 2r + 16 + 2r + 22 = 4r + 60. Equating these expressions gives us the equation 6r + 24 = 4r + 60. Solving for r yields r = 18.

Edges of a cube arc formed where two faces meet, so each edge is the edge of two faces of the cube. If we color only two edges of the cube red, then at most four of the six faces will have a red edge, which is not enough. We will need at least three red edges. The diagTam below gives an example of such an edge coloring:




We proceed by considering the number of digits. Among the one-digit pasitivc integers, only 6 and 9 use six matchsticks (we do not count 0 since it is not positive, even though it uses six matchsticks). For a number with two digits, either both digits use three matchsticks, or one uses two and the other uses four, so that the total number of matchsticks will be six. In the first case, we have 14 and 41, and in the second case we have 77. For a number with three digits, we must have each of the digits using two matchsticks (no number uses only one matchstick). The only number satisfying this is
111. Thus, the six numbers arc 6, 9, 14, 41, 77, and 111.

If we pick vertices which share a side of the square, we can draw an equilateral triangle using the line segment between the vertices as one side, and the la.st vertex of this triangle is a point which is equidistant from our original vertices. There will be two such triangles for each pair of points, one a reflection of the other. There arc four such pairs of points, so we get 2 x 4 = 8 points which arc equidistant from two vertices on the square which share a side. If we instead pick vertices along the diagonal of the square, the two points which arc equidistant from these points arc the other two vertices of the square. This gives an additional four points, for a total of 12 points. This diagTam shows all such points:

Since 6ABC is isosceles, LBAC = LACB =   ;    = 70°. Considering the triangle 6AC F, we have LAFC + LC AF+ LAC F = 180°. Solving for the first angle yields
LAFC = 180° -  LCAF - LACF = 180° -  (70° -  LBAE) - LACF.
Using the fact that LBAE= LACF, we have LAFC = 180°- 70°+LACF- LAC F =
110°. The angle L? is supplementary to LAFC, so that L? = 70°.



Tom and John hit the outer ring a combined total of four times, the second ring four times, and the middle four times. Lily hit each ring twice, so the combined score of Tom and John is exactly twice as much as Lily's score. Tom and John have a combined

Let h and b be the height and base length of the white rectangle.  Then, then h
is the common height of each of the four non-overlapping white triangles and 2b i2s

the four triangles is l  x 2b x h = l x b x h , which is half the area of the white

rectangle. The other half is the area of the gray rectangle, and we know that this area is 3 x 25 cm2  = 75 cm2	So, the area of the whole rectangle is 2 x 75 cm2  = 150 cm2

Two extra lines is not sufficient to obtain all eight angle values because adding two extra lines gives a total of four lines, and for 4 lines fl, f2, f3, f4 there can be at most 6 different angles:
L(fl,f2), L(fl,f3),L(fl,f4), L(f2,f3),L(f2,f4),andL(f3, f4).
Three extra lines suffice, as in the example below.

If we only use positive integers, the sum would be much larger than 2023. Indeed, the only way to sum 2023 positive integers and get 2023 is if all the integers arc equal to 1, but we need consecutive integers, which arc all distinct.  Therefore, we must

-1011, ..., -2, -1, 0,1, 2, ..., 1011. We can then shift this sequence by oncin the positive direction to get our desired sum of 2023. The sequence -1010,..., 1012 consists of 2023 consecutive integers, and the sum of these is 1011+ 1012 = 2023, since -1010,..., 1010
sum to 0. The largest of these integers is 1012 and the sum of its digits is 1+0+ 1+2 = 4.

Since three kangaroos arc standing next to another kangaroo, it must be the case that all three of these kangaroos arc standing next to each other. Otherwise, we would have to break up these three and would have at least one standing alone. So the sequence BK K KB must arise in the circle. Since no two beavers arc standing next to each other, we can add a kangaroo to each side of this sequence: KB KKK BK. We cannot add more kangaroos since we already have three standing next to another kangaroo. We can close this circle by adding a third and final beaver. So we have five kangaroos in total.

The average speed is determined by dividing the total distance traveled by the time taken to travel this distance. Let f be the side length of the equilateral triangle. The total distance traveled by the ant is then 3£ cm. To determine the time taken to travel along each edge, we use the formula: distance = (rate)(time), so that time =
distance/rate. Thus, the total time taken to traverse all sides of the triangle is

We work backwards through the information given to generate the graph shown below. Since there arc seven dwarves, and Doc played six games, he must have played a game against every other dwarf on Monday. Happy played five games, so did not play against one of the dwarves. Happy must not have played against Grumpy, because Grumpy only played one game on Monday, which must have been against Doc. Similarly, Bashful played against all dwarves except for Grumpy and Sncczy, since their games
arc already accounted for. This completes the graph below (where 1 = Grumpy, 2 =
Sncczy, etc.), and we can sec that? = Dopey played three games.

The numbers 8 and 9 can only have 1 in an adjacent region, so they must be placed in the square regions on the left and right sides, while 1 is placed in the central hexagon. There arc two choices for this placement: 8 on the left and 9 on the right, or vice versa. The numbers 6 and 7 can only have 1 or 2 in an adjacent region, so they must be placed in a region with only two adjacent regions. Therefore, 7 must be placed in one of the four remaining square regions, which gives an additional 4 choices. This choice then determines where 2 is placed (in the triangular region adjacent to 7) and 6 is placed adjacent to 2. At this point, it remains to place 3, 4, and 5. The numbers 4 and 5 cannot be placed in adjacent regions, so must be put in the two remaining square regions, with 3 in the triangular region between them. There arc two choices for this placement: 4 on the left and 5 on the right, or vice versa. In total, this yields
2 x 4 x 2 = 16 configurations, one of which is given below.

28 is an even number and the last position is an odd number, so 28 < 2n + 1. Also, n + 1 < 19. Solving these inequalities yields 13.5 < n < 18, son can only be 14,15,16, or 17. Then the total number of people in line could be 29, 31, 33, or 35. Since the number of people in line must be a multiple of 3, we have 33 people in line, n = 16, and thus Martin is 17th in line.

Since every mouse left their house, the number of mice that left the two houses on the left is 7 + 8 = 15. The number of mice that arrived at the house on the right is 4. These 4 mice did not use the path of interest, so the number that did is 15 - 4 = 11.

Since the ones digit of 2023 is a 3, we must use a column of nine 7's because the only multiple of 7 ending in a 3 is 7 x 9 = 63. This gives 6 to carry. The sum of the digits in the tens column must end with a 6 so that we have 6 +6 = 12 to make this end with
a 2, which means we need a column of eight 7's as 8 x 7 = 56. Now this column has a 6 to carry so we need 14 = 7 + 7 on the left most column. The whole sum is shown in the figure below.

We arc searching for a sequence of six consecutive whole numbers which we know con- tains 6, 7, and 8. The possible sequences arc (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
and (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). It is impossible to obtain 23 as the sum of three numbers from
(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) since the largest possible three-term sum is 21. It is also impossible to
obtain 17 from either (5,6, 7,8, 9,10) or (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) since the smallest possible three-term sums arc 18 and 21, respectively. So our sequence must be (4,5,6, 7,8,9), and we arc missing the numbers 4, 5, and 9. Their sum is 18.

22 x 6 = 132, they could have scored at most 131 total points in their first six games.
Their average after 10 games was more than 22, so they scored more than 22 x 10 = 220 points over these 10 games (i.e., at least 221 points). In order to score 221 points in total, they need to score 221 - 131 - 66 = 24 points in the tenth game.
